960,business,fed warns of more us rate rises the us looks set for a continued boost to interest rates in 2005  according to the federal reserve.  minutes of the december meeting which pushed rates up to 2.25% showed that policy-makers at the fed are worried about accelerating inflation. the clear signal pushed the dollar up to $1.3270 to the euro by 0400 gmt on wednesday  but depressed us shares.  the markets are starting to fear a more aggressive fed in 2005   said richard yamarone of argus research. the dow jones index dropped almost 100 points on tuesday  with the nasdaq also falling as key tech stocks were hit by broker downgrades. the dollar also gained ground against sterling on tuesday  reaching $1.8832 to the pound before slipping slightly on wednesday morning.  the release of the minutes just three weeks after the 14 december meeting was much faster than usual  indicating the fed wants to keep markets more apprised of its thinking. this  too  is being taken in some quarters as a sign of aggressive moves on interest rates to come. the key fed funds rate has risen 1.25 percentage points during 2004 from the 46-year low of 1% reached not long after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. that long trough  might be contributing to signs of potentially excessive risk-taking in financial markets   said the federal open markets committee (fomc)  which sets interest rates. the odds now favour a further boost to rates at the next meeting in early february  economists said. but the respite for the dollar  which spent late 2003 being pushed lower against other major currencies by worries about massive us trade and budget deficits  may be short-lived.  you can t rule out a further correction... but we don t think it s a change in direction in the dollar   said jason daw at merrill lynch.  nothing fundamental has changed.,0.12032938
2062,politics,will the budget bring out smiling voters  as tory spokesman oliver letwin said - any chancellor would use his pre-election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners  wouldn t he.  and everyone does  indeed  expect gordon brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of 5 may. there will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways. but mr brown will stun westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters  faces and make them more inclined to back labour in the election. and there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week s budget. the aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core labour voters in the fold  while ensuring the middle england voters who gave tony blair two election victories don t desert him at the third poll.  and  needless to say  there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the budget will have on mr brown s own ambitions to replace mr blair as prime minister at some point after a third win. but there is a shadow hanging over this pre-election performance - in the shape of £11 billion or thereabouts. that is the size of the financial  black hole  the tories  backed by some independent forecasters  believe mr brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election.  the opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a treasury leak suggested mr brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash. it was immediately denied  but the tories remain suspicious  claiming that  as mr letwin said  if the money does not come from there  where will it come from.  mr brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election  should labour win. previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong  he will argue  while suggesting that only by sticking with him can britain continue to have a sound economy  low unemployment and high public spending. the opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound  increase spending and cut taxes at the same time.  the liberal democrats will also promise to run a sound economy  but based on increased taxes to fund spending and  amongst other things  abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax. and there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in whitehall and beyond to fund their policies. but probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years. and it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election.,3.0611737

739,politics,labour s election love-in peace and love have been in short supply in the labour party in recent days.  if press reports are to be believed  alan milburn and gordon brown have been at each other s throats over the contents of labour s next election manifesto. but the pair were all smiles on tuesday morning  as they joined john prescott to unveil labour s latest poster campaign. the event - at old billingsgate fish market on the banks of the thames - was a carefully choreographed show of unity. and the surest sign yet that we are heading for a general election in the next few months. it was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years.  the first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when - in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions - labour s speakers crackled to life with the sound of booker t and the mgs. then a vw camper van trundled into view  decked out in that most mind-bending of psychedelic messages -  lowest mortgage rate for 40 years . as the side-door slid open  it looked for one glorious moment as if the cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together  scooby doo-style. but  sadly  it wasn t the cabinet who had raided the dressing-up box - just six rather ill-at-ease looking labour students. two were dressed as regency dandies - to unveil a poster trumpeting  the longest period of economic growth for 200 years . another pair of students were in a beatle wig and sgt pepper jacket to highlight the  lowest interest rates since the 1960s .  the remaining two were dressed in a vague approximation of disco chic to demonstrate the  lowest unemployment since the seventies .  the politicians - led out by john prescott - were soberly-suited as always. the event may have been designed to highlight labour s economic success under mr brown  but there was little doubt who was in charge. the chancellor walked side-by-side with mr milburn  pointedly exchanging chit chat  as they approached the microphone. but it was mr milburn who took centre stage  speaking of the  positive campaign  the party hoped to stage in the  coming weeks and months .  the mobile poster vans would  let people know britain is working again . mr brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of labour s  shared purpose  and  united dedication . it was left to mr prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellor s record and  in a final flourish  to produce his famous pledge card  from 1997  claiming labour has met all of its promises. the event was carefully stage-managed to underline cabinet unity. and  more specifically  to demonstrate the  central role  mr brown will play in the election campaign  despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of mr milburn.  but keen students of body language will have had a field day. there was much forced smiling for the cameras  but only mr prescott  who revels in such occasions  seemed to be truly enjoying himself. mr milburn made a point of turning to face the chancellor  as he spoke  nodding thoughtfully. but it was the former health secretary s final gesture  placing an arm on mr brown s back as they walked away from the microphones  which was perhaps the most telling. thanks for dropping by gordon  he might have been saying.,-0.73292446

1273,tech,millions to miss out on the net by 2025  40% of the uk s population will still be without internet access at home  says a study.  around 23 million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information  predicts the report by telecoms giant bt. it compares to 27 million  or 50%  of the uk  who are not currently online. the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is  wishful thinking   the report concludes.  the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly  those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more  the report suggests. as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive  the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access  it predicts.  the gap between  have-nets  and  have-nots  has been much talked about  but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark  the report suggests.  internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it   said adrian hosford  director of corporate responsibility at bt. costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological.  there is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. they don t have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits   said mr hosford.  as now  the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families  the older generation and the disabled.  those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots  the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025  the report forecasts. organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem  said mr hosford. the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain. in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment  online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs  explained mr hosford. such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome  he said.  if we don t address this problem now  it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs  education opportunities will be limited and they ll simply not be able to keep up with society   he said. the alliance for digital inclusion  an independent body with members drawn from government  industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.,-0.36500454

1893,tech,mobiles get set for visual radio the growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade has been nothing less than astonishing  but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked. games  cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years  but 2005 could see another big innovation that won t just see a change in our mobile phone habits - it might alter the way we listen to the radio. finnish handset giant nokia has been working on a technology called visual radio  which takes an existing fm signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures. it is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested - the early days of dab digital radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day.  one problem is that the name visual radio leads people to think of television but reidar wasenius  a senior project manager at nokia  was adamant that visual radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium. he said:  i m very happy to say it s not television  what we re talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today.  if you have a visual radio enabled handset  when you hear an artist you don t know  or there s a competition or vote that you d like to participate in  you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on-air broadcast you ve just been listening to.   that visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station  and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to. as well as details on the track or artist of a particular song  there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself  in a similar way to digital television s  red button  content.  possible interactive content includes competitions  votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing. but the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations  who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a real-time basis. this in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue  as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners.  as the visual radio content is transmitted by existing gprs technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network. and there will be a cost for the service as well  although it may depend on your usage.  if you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it ll be two or three pounds per month   said mr wasenius.  but typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an  all you can eat  arrangement per month.  the payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dial-up connections. one thing that is for sure - assuming that nokia retains its market share in handsets  it is estimating that there will be 100 million visual radio-enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of 2006.  basically  visual radio is not really revolutionary  but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before.   the first visual radio service in the uk will begin in a few months time with virgin radio  who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners. station manager steve taylor commented:  listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way.  not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like; mp3 music downloads and the latest gig tickets.  initially visual radio functionality will be limited to two nokia handsets due out soon - the 3230 and 7710 - but if successful  it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them.  listen again to the interview on the radio five live website.,0.5568547
356,politics,green fear for transport ballot the green party is concerned thousands of residents may not be able to vote in edinburgh s transport referendum.  edinburgh city council is to ballot constituents on proposals to introduce congestion charging in the capital. but green msp mark ballard fears people not on the council s edited electoral register may miss out. local authorities can only send ballot papers to those on the edited list over non-statutory matters  such as the transport referendum. therefore  residents who have exercised their right to have their details left off the list could miss the chance to vote.  however  there is still time for those who are not on the list to contact the council and make sure they are sent ballot forms ahead of february s voting deadline. mr ballard said:  this vote will set the future of transport in edinburgh for decades to come.  it is therefore vital that as many residents as possible in edinburgh city and the surrounding areas  are registered to vote in the ballot.  many people are not aware that they may miss out on their chance to have a say.  everyone involved in this debate - both for and against - wants the ballot to be as fair and representative as possible  and that means encouraging people to take part.  the ballot will ask residents to vote for or against the council s proposed congestion charge scheme and a host of transport improvements to be funded by it. the outcome of the referendum will be known next month after the ballot forms are sent out and returned to the council. towards the end of february  the council will meet to decide whether to proceed with an application to scottish ministers for approval for its planned congestion charging scheme and the other parts of its transport package.,-0.54031515

2206,politics,kennedy questions trust of blair lib dem leader charles kennedy has said voters now have a  fundamental lack of trust  of tony blair as prime minister.  he said backing his party was not a wasted vote  adding that with the lib dems  what you see is what you get . he made his comments at the start of a day of appearances on channel five in a session on the wright stuff programme. questions from callers  a studio audience and the show s presenter covered lib dem tax plans  anti-terror laws and immigration.  mr kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of british politics.  1983 was when i was first elected as an mp - so tony blair  michael howard and myself were all class of  83 - and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition   he said.  we don t actually hear the argument any longer:  lib dems  good people  reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here - it s a wasted vote .  you don t hear that because the evidence of people s senses demonstrates that it isn t a wasted vote.  but he said mr blair had lost the trust of the british people.  there is a fundamental lack of trust in tony blair as prime minister and in his government   he said.   what we ve got to do as a party - what i ve got to do as a leader of this party - is to convey to people that what you see is what you get.  mr kennedy also used his tv appearance to defend his party s plans to increase income tax to 50% for those earning more than £100 000  saying it would apply to just 1% of the population. he said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top-up fees  introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. mr blair has already spent a day with five and michael howard is booked for a similar session.,4.282666
161,politics,howard s unfinished business  he s not finished yet   whispered the conservative party person as your reporter attempted to slip quietly from the hall. and indeed he wasn t. michael howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech  at his party s spring conference in brighton  to deliver a smart rebuff to peter hain s description of him as an  attack mongrel   claiming such personal abuse meant labour was  rattled  by the tory challenge. and here he was again  moving to the front of the stage as the party faithful rose to their feet in applause  to make a personal  ad-libbed appeal to them to go out and fight for victory.  one day you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren as i will tell mine   i was there. i did my bit. i played my part. i helped to win that famous election - the election that transformed our country for the better .  the speech  which was peppered with references to mr howard s humble beginnings as the  child of immigrants   had been introduced by his son nick  a trainee vicar  who praised his father s honesty.  i always know where i am with him because all my life he has meant what he has said to me   he said. mr howard was also joined on stage by his wife sandra  daughter larissa and stepson sholto.  the audience s reaction to all of this was a little muted by party conference standards.  but mr howard s overall message - that the tories have labour on the run and that they can win the next election - did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago. mr howard claimed  with some justification  that the tories  campaign has got off to a  great start . they have had labour on the back foot over immigration  with tony blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card  and have even managed to score points in traditional labour territory such as health and education. the stunts involving margaret dixon with her postponed operation and maria hutchings with concerns about her son s special needs education may not have been to everyone s taste  but they succeeded in bringing the issues alive and forcing labour to react. senior tories believe they are  at long last  starting to tap into the public mood  cutting through the background noise to connect with the ordinary voter. their latest poster campaign flags up a range of policies from better school discipline  cleaner hospitals ( i mean  how hard is it to keep a hospital clean  ) and immigration ( it s not racist to impose limits on immigration ) - under the headline  are you thinking what we are thinking   this  they say  contrasts with labour s negative campaigning  such as its now infamous  flying pigs  poster.  oliver letwin  one of the men lampooned in the labour poster  affects bewilderment at what he believes is labour s loss of its once sure footing on the campaign trail. the peter hain  mongrel  attack  he says  is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong - a by-product  he claims  of the tories setting the agenda.   i have to say i don t understand what they are doing. the labour machine appears to be in some kind of state of shock  it doesn t seem to know what to do.  a few weeks of positive headlines have also done wonders for tory activists  morale - likely to be a crucial factor at an election which  most analysts seem to agree  will hinge on which party can get their core support out.  it has been a fantastic few weeks   said 20-year-old politics student nick vaughan.  our policies have been getting in the media and there is a sense that we can win. i wouldn t be here if i didn t think we could.  some delegates even spoke of the next election being like 1970  when ted heath  behind in the polls and written off by the pundits  snatched victory from harold wilson s labour party.  they all insisted it was not going to be a re-run of 2001.  we thought in 2001 we were going to dent that massive majority but it just didn t happen   said john murray  of aldridge browhills conservatives.  it was very disappointing. this time it really is different.  whoever is running our strategy from the top has got it bang on. blair is on the back foot.  much of the credit for the tories  recent change of fortune must go to lynton crosby  the australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent no-hoper john howard  of australia s liberal party  into a serial election winner. the tories still have a mountain climb if michael howard is to walk through the doors of number 10. even allowing for the natural bias against the tories in some opinion polls  they are still behind  when to have a chance of overturning labour s whopping majority  they should really be ahead. but as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper  the party at least has reason to hope that  like his australian namesake  mr howard really isn t finished yet.,-1.0273771
610,tech,broadband fuels online expression fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online  research suggests.  a quarter of broadband users in britain regularly upload content and have personal sites  according to a report by uk think-tank demos. it said that having an always-on  fast connection is changing the way people use the internet. more than five million households in the uk have broadband and that number is growing fast.  the demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people s net habits. it found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast. one in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web.  more significantly  argues the report  broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online. it found that one in five post something on the net everyday  ranging from comments or opinions on sites to uploading photographs.  broadband is putting the  me  in media as it shifts power from institutions and into the hands of the individual   said john craig  co-author of the demos report.  from self-diagnosis to online education  broadband creates social innovation that moves the debate beyond simple questions of access and speed.  the demos report  entitled broadband britain: the end of asymmetry   was commissioned by net provider aol.  broadband is moving the perception of the internet as a piece of technology to an integral part of home life in the uk   said karen thomson  chief executive of aol uk   with many people spending time on their computers as automatically as they might switch on the television or radio.  according to analysts nielsen//netratings  more than 50% of the 22.8 million uk net users regularly accessing the web from home each month are logging on at high speed they spend twice as long online than people on dial-up connections  viewing an average of 1 444 pages per month. the popularity of fast net access is growing  partly fuelled by fierce competition over prices and services.,-0.0971508
385,politics,ukip s secret weapon  by any measure  new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else - a winner.  this is the man who  some pundits believe  was almost single-handedly responsible for bill clinton s sensational 1992 comeback victory. but morris is no ideologue. he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and  more recently  politicians from mexico to uruguay. now he is back in london as the uk independence party s not-so-secret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped - you guessed it - opposition candidate viktor yushchenko. if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris  it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances. that he enjoys the game more than the politics.  so why britain and why ukip which  despite its recent eu election successes  is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election. on this subject  morris appears almost evangelical.   i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and  coincidentally  so was ukip leader roger knapman.  i had just written a piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there . but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him  many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art  irrespective of the politics.  i think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism . a great soundbite  but a surprise coming from a new yorker post 11 september.  it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better  who don t believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined.  that s international bankers  the world trade organisation  the international monetary fund  the world bank and  primarily  the european union .  so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic. and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable.  the tory party is schizophrenic about europe. but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they can t possibly re-negotiate anything (as michael howard is pledged to do).  it s like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying:  before i can proceed with the robbery i want to make clear i am not going to shoot anybody  . possibly a very american analogy  but another great soundbite.  the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain - and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose it .  so is ukip s job to destroy the tories  as former member robert kilroy-silk once notoriously declared   no. the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories  spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move.   but it s not just to shift the tories. i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair s decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro . and  while we are on the subject of mr kilroy-silk  mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites.  robert kilroy silk is not a team player - it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one .  so what is the big plan for the general election. how will he achieve the breakthrough   look  we are not going to be forming the next government   he said. neither does ukip have to fight every seat. as with the 2004 us presidential election  he says  the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in britain. so  with limited resources  the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the commons. he also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll.  the internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries). people just did it .  anything can happen in the next general election. there is an inherent instability at the moment.  labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice .  that might  he suggests  lead to a hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power. it is a huge task  surely. but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is labour s for the taking. ukip s performance in last year s european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus. and after all  he has a reputation to sustain.,-0.3036623
340,tech,looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales  according to research from technology analysts gartner.  more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally  said the report  the highest total sold to date. the figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions  gartner said. good design and the look of a mobile  as well as new services such as music downloads  could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005  said analysts. although people were still looking for better replacement phones  there was evidence  according to gartner  that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales.   all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe   mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website.  japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years  time.  they already have tv  music  ringtones  cameras  and all that we can think of on mobiles  so people have stopped buying replacement phones.   but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too  according to gartner  as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade  said gartner. third generation mobiles (3g) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer  like video  could drive people into upgrading their phones  but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen.  at the end of the day  people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don t really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical.  nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms.  more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics  as well as music services. the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005  she added. this was not a  women s thing   she said  but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. it was not just about how the phone functioned  but about what it said about its owner.  western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design   said ms milanesi.   people are after something that is nice-looking  and together with that  there is the entertainment side.  this year music will have a part to play in this.  the market for full-track music downloads was worth just $20 million (£10.5 million) in 2004  but is set to be worth $1.8 billion (£94 million) by 2009  according to juniper research. sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone  the w800  which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours  battery life  and a two megapixel camera. in july last year  motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones. apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola s standard music application for its music phones. but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod. ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity  which would not put too much strain on battery life.,1.1175933

1738,business,golden economic period  to end ten years of  golden  economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly  city consultancy deloitte has warned.  the uk economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market  triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment. deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year  below chancellor gordon brown s forecast of 3% to 3.5%. it also believes that interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of the year.  in its quarterly economic review  deloitte said the uk economy had enjoyed a  golden period  during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s.  but it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major  imbalances  in the economy. deloitte s chief economic advisor roger bootle said:  the biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown.  whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth  this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.   economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes  deloitte believes. gordon brown will need to raise about $10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term  the firm claims. this will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year  when the economy expanded by 3.25%. however  deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the bank of england to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering. it expects a series of  aggressive  interest rate cuts over the next two years  with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006.  although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong  it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the uk economy   mr bootle.,1.0223222

2224,sport,souness delight at euro progress boss graeme souness felt newcastle were never really in danger of going out of the uefa cup against heerenveen.  an early own goal followed by an alan shearer strike earned them a 2-1 win and a place in the uefa cup last 16.  obviously with winning in the first leg it gave us a great advantage   he said after the 4-2 aggregate victory.  we got our goals early and in the minds of some players the job was done but then they got a goal and perhaps made us a bit nervous.  shearer s goal moved him within 12 of jackie milburn s club scoring record of 200 for the magpies. but souness said he did not think beating the record would have any bearing on his decision to retire at the end of the season.  i think if he got it this year he would want to stay next year anyway   he added.   he struck the ball very well - he always has done - and i think it was the power and pace that beat the goalkeeper.  souness also paid tribute to laurent robert  who was at the heart of much of united s attacking play.  in the first half he did really well and did everything you want from a wide player. more of the same in future please   he said.,1.533318

1150,tech,intel unveils laser breakthrough intel has said it has found a way to put a silicon-based laser on a chip  raising hopes of much faster networks.  scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade.   we ve overcome a fundamental limit   said dr mario paniccia  director of intel s photonics technology lab. writing in the journal nature  dr paniccia - and colleagues haisheng rong  richard jones  ansheng liu  oded cohen  dani hak and alexander fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. currently  says dr paniccia  telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials  such as gallium arsenide  used to make it.  telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved.  we re trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas   said dr paniccia. while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around  before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it  some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material.  it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light   he said. but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. even better  the laser light produced in this way can  with the help of easy-to-make filters  be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses.  it s a technical validation that it can work   he said.,0.73603487

57,sport,henson stakes early lions claim the six nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer.  the player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting xv over the weekend was gavin henson. he s very confident. you just had to listen to his interview afterwards - he beamed with confidence - but although there s an element of arrogance it s good arrogance. he certainly showed some nice touches. he once showed a clean pair of heels to mathew tait when he got outside him  his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand. and that s without even mentioning his majestic match-winning penalty. but i think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test. he needs to come up against brian o driscoll or a big french midfield. wales fly-half stephen jones was another player who impressed me. he gave good direction  he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side. he showed he can control a game. with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and jones  or maybe even henson  could make the lions team at fly-half.  jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than charlie hodgson after saturday s game. some of the wales forwards surprised me because i thought they would be out-muscled in the tight five. england prop julian white is a capable player but when it comes down to selection gethin jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top. however  i still think white and phil vickery will be in the frame. some english players did their cause no harm. i thought joe worsley had a solid game and jason robinson and josh lewsey both did nothing wrong. but it looked too soon for young mathew tait and i think it will be a while before we see him again. despite being written off beforehand several scots caught my eye against france.  tom smith has been there and done it before  but the likes of chris cusiter  jason white and ally hogg all made their mark. hogg made a couple of good runs while white had a pretty robust game - his defence is right up there. cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for lions coach sir clive woodward. the star of ireland s win over italy in rome looks like a certainty to make the starting xv against new zealand. brian o driscoll is a class act. he ran some good lines against italy  made the breaks and fed his outside backs  although italy defended man on man which made it easy for him. gordon d arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but i think you could get a henson  d arcy  o driscoll combination in the lions midfield. paul o connell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and malcolm o kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up  while shane byrne seems to be a lively character. but they will be a bit worried after the italian pack drove them off their own ball on sunday  although i used to play in italy and i know how difficult it can be. one player who didn t impress me was wales scrum-half dwayne peel. he choked late on in the second half when wales were trailing. they had good possession and he kicked the ball away - i wouldn t want him as my lions scrum-half after that.,0.9537883

706,sport,ireland 21-19 argentina an injury-time dropped goal by ronan o gara stole victory for ireland from underneath the noses of argentina at lansdowne road on saturday.  o gara kicked all of ireland s points  with two dropped goals and five penalties  to give the home side a 100% record in their autumn internationals. an impressive argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds. the pumas shocked the irish early on with a try from federico aramburu  and felipe contepomi kicked 14 points. the well-drilled and sharper pumas out-played and out-thought ireland in the early stages. indiscipline allowed argentina s leinster fly-half contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty. he was on the mark again two minutes later when argentina shocked a ragged ireland with the first try of the game. ireland turned the ball over and manuel contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner aramburu to sprint in under the posts. o gara finally got ireland on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later. playing into a strong wind and rain  ireland continued to come second best in tight situations  and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence. o gara managed to land his second penalty in the 36th minute  but once again contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first-half injury time. the second-half started as the first had ended. o gara rifled over another penalty in the 45th minute  but contepomi matched it three minutes later. the upper-body strength of the pumas never allowed ireland to take control up front  while the three-quarters had no space to manoeuvre. ireland had to rely on o gara s boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays. the munsterman landed two more penalties - one of them from 48 metres - to bring his team to within four points with 13 minutes on the clock remaining. and ireland s chance came when argentina s number eight gonzalo longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line-out. o gara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes. but ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow o gara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous  if fortuitous  comeback.,0.7103491

995,entertainment,lasting influence of legend charles ray charles  who has won a string of posthumous grammy awards  belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.  his sound encompassed so many styles - blues  gospel  jazz  rock  n  roll  even country - and had a real impact on the nascent uk beat and r&b scenes.  compared in stature to elvis presley by some commentators  charles  songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as joe cocker  steve winwood  eric burdon and van morrison. his influence has extended to contemporary artists such as norah jones  with whom he recently recorded a duet. if james brown was the godfather of soul  then ray charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. along with sam cooke  he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south baptist church with the  devil s  music of r&b to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.  without charles  it is hard to imagine the tear-stained atlantic r&b sound of aretha franklin  otis redding or wilson pickett. he was also a talented jazz composer  arranger and band leader  playing at the newport jazz festival and carnegie hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as milt jackson and david  fathead  newman. unfortunately  he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction  which led to him being arrested in 1965. his string of 1950s atlantic r&b successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock  n  roll greats  including i ve got a woman (roy orbison  elvis presley) and hallelujah  i love her so (eddie cochran). after the exuberance of his 1959 signature song what d i say  charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style  recording hoagy carmichael s sentimental string ballad georgia on my mind  and the upbeat hit the road jack.  he also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of hank williams standards such as your cheating heart and you win again. more than 40 years after its release  his 1962 abc album modern sounds in country and western music is still regarded as a classic. his version of don gibson s i can t stop loving you topped the pop and r&b charts in the us. in 1972  he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album a message from the people.  on it  he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as stevie wonder  james brown  curtis mayfield and marvin gaye. more than 20 years later  he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album my world  which featured hip-hop beats - although charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when charles died aged 73 in june 2004 was one from his friend  the producer quincy jones  who described him as a  brother in every sense of the word .  there will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as ray charles did   he said. former manfred mann singer paul jones  who sang on 1960s hits such as come tomorrow and sha la la  said charles was one of his heroes.  i m quite sure my own writing was influenced by him   he told bbc news online.  i would put money on the proposition that ray charles will have an influence on music forever.,-3.4374456
817,politics,no more concessions  on terror charles clarke says he has  no desire  to offer more concessions on his controversial anti-terror plans to get them on to the statute book.  mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes - but labour s majority was reduced to 14. the bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. lord strathclyde  tory leader in the lords  said ministers should expect it to be  substantially re-written .  the bill proposes  control orders   which as well as house arrest could impose curfews  tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial  which the law lords have ruled against.  on monday  mps voted 272-219 in favour of the bill after key concessions from mr clarke. the government earlier saw its 161-strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly rejected by the commons despite the support of 62 labour rebels. mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order  amounting to house arrest  would be imposed by judges and not politicians. lord strathclyde warned ministers that they should  prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the bill .  they should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and i think they should drop the most objectionable proposals  which are for house arrest.   but mr clarke told bbc radio 4 s today programme he believed the changes he had made to the bill to win over critics in the commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the lords.  no bill goes through parliament without detailed consideration being made  but i believe that what i announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the house of lords   he said.   i have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the bill.  mr clarke s proposed amendment will be debated by the lords on tuesday without having been considered by mps. the debate is unlikely to result in a vote. speaking after the commons debate  shadow home secretary david davies said the bill had been  clearly very badly drawn-up  and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly. he said it would be possible to  rescue  the government and make the law  tolerable  by amending it in the lords.  the scope for miscarriages of justice is enormous   he told bbc news.  mark oaten  for the liberal democrats  said monday night s vote showed the government had  lost the confidence of all sides of the house . he said:  they need to rethink the bill  and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders  build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects.  unless there is a major movement  this bill is doomed to fail.   bbc news political editor andrew marr said:  i think that this is a bill in deep trouble. it s been unravelling in the house of commons - it may unravel further.  the government wants the new bill to pass into law by 14 march  when the current powers expire.,1.5922129
2005,politics,police urge pub closure power new powers are needed to close disorderly pubs  bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently  police chiefs have told mps.  association of chief police officers president chris fox said the current 24-hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords. mr fox s comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock. he rejected critics  calls for the law change to be delayed. instead  the new licensing act could help reduce drunken disorder - but only if it was properly planned  he argued.  acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the commons home affairs select committee. after the meeting  mr fox said being able to close premises for only 24 hours did not necessarily make an impact.  if it s 12.30 on a saturday morning and you close for 24 hours there s not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn t open on sunday anyway.   this is about getting through to the management that they can t run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions.  under acpo s proposal  the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority. the new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs - but only for 24-hour periods.  mr fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself.  it s making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse  and the strategic planning process has been less than useless   he said. mr fox said the new laws  due to start being phased in next month  could help if food outlets  public transport and public toilets could cope with late-night drinkers.  staggering it (closing hours) will be a solution if the infrastructure is there  if the premises are properly managed and people aren t being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street   he said.  we have the problem from 11pm to 2am in any event. we have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this.   acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs. home secretary charles clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing. the licensing changes have sparked concern among some mps  councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems. culture secretary tessa jowell on tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes. it was the status quo  not the new laws  which were causing current binge drinking problems  she told bbc two s newsnight. leaked documents have suggested ex-home secretary david blunkett branded new opening hours as a  leap in the dark . but ms jowell insisted his concerns had been met. the police s job against alcohol-related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time  she added.,0.54386806
2205,entertainment,dance music not dead says fatboy dj norman cook - aka fatboy slim - has said that dance music is not dead  but has admitted it is currently going through a  fallow patch .  the commercial failure of the latest albums by britain s two biggest dance acts - fatboy slim s palookaville and the prodigy s always outnumbered never outgunned - has been coupled with the closure of many  superclubs   and the folding of three dance music magazines. last month the brit awards announced they would no longer be awarding a best dance act prize  with the brits committee announcing that  dance music is no longer where it s happening in music.  these developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre. cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album  halfway between the gutter and the stars  but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over.  every week when i was making the album  i was reading articles about the demise of dance music - and obviously that affects you somewhat   he told bbc world service s the ticket programme.  i personally don t believe it s either dead or going to die  but it s going through a bit of a fallow patch.  so i think  consciously or subconsciously  reading every week that dance music was dead i would think  right  scrub that track then .   although his album sales in the uk are down - palookaville stayed in the uk top 75 for just three weeks - cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties. and event on brighton sea front in 2002 attracted 250 000  people  while a later one in rio achieved a crowd of 360 000. the dvd of the rio set was the biggest seller of that year.   with a crowd that big  if the weather s nice  the atmosphere before i even go is so good that about halfway through the first record i think  i ve got them    cook said.  i m always really really nervous before the big ones - they had to give me valium before rio  because two hours before i was literally just pacing the floor.  for some reason  especially now i ve got a reputation for it  the atmosphere and the joie de vivre that s already going on means all i have to do is play  up  records.  he promised more such parties in more locations around the world - despite problems after the brighton event  which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt. one man also died of a heart attack  and a woman fell to her death during the free party.  we re having to widen our horizons from just beaches  because there s landlocked countries that want to get involved   cook said.  we re doing rio at the carnival  at the maracana  and sao paolo - our new gig is famous football stadiums.   the dj admitted  however  that his massive worldwide success had a downside  with intense media interest in his personal life. in particular  he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary break-up of his marriage to radio one presenter zoe ball  after she was linked with dj dan peppe.   the tabloid thing has been difficult at times   cook said.  especially the me-and-zoe-gate - it s quite scary.  he said that he had been  determined  that what had happened with ball did not affect the album.  at first i was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldn t think i was depressed   he explained.  then i thought   that s not right .  and he highlighted a bizarre coincidence - that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended.  i said to zoe   i did this track called my masochistic baby went and left me  do you mind if it s on the album    he recalled.  she said   yeah  it s hilarious  because your masochistic baby did leave you .  cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure  which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on - where paul mccartney is a neighbour.  it s almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs   cook explained.  if there s a pap at the end of the road  everyone knocks on each other s doors - paul comes round  and we warn him  because we don t know who they re after.,-0.84953165

1653,tech,file-swappers ready new network legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down.  one site behind the success of the bittorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january. but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are  quality copies .  in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network. the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised. that file-sharing system relies on links called  trackers  that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for. shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network. one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to.  now the man behind suprnova.org  who goes by the nickname sloncek  is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed exeem. in an interview with novastream web radio  sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file-sharing systems. like bittorrent  exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want. like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. there will be no centrally maintained list. this  said sloncek  should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. an early public version of the software should be available before february. sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development. there were no plans for a linux or mac version. he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. despite suprnova administrator sloncek s involvement with exeem  the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis.  users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files  sloncek told novastream.  dr johan pouwelse  a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer-to-peer networks  said exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems. but  he said  it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared.  exeem cannot prevent pollution   he said.  the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings   he said. studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes. by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality.  the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that s full of crap like kazaa   he said.  there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity   he said. mr pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading. when big files were being shared moderation systems were key  said mr pouwelse. he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic.  it s hard to compete with free   he said. no-one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development.,4.2148967
236,tech,kenyan school turns to handhelds at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus.  they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. it is a pilot project run by eduvision  which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e-slates.  the e-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. the data is transmitted alongside audio signals.  the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld e-slates.  it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream  sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. it also stores this on its hard disc.   the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project.  it s very simple to set up  just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school  but it s also a one-way connection  so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult.   the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linux-based system.  the content is divided into visual information  textual information and questions. users can scroll through these sections independently of each other.  eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world s largest university libraries.  all books in the public domain  something like 15 million  could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them. then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard  currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity. but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions.  we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station  have the e-slates charge during the day when the children are in school  then they can take them home at night and continue working.  maciej sundra  who designed the user interface for the e-slates  says the project s ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world.  why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks  the fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting - as they need it most.,-2.182228

1436,entertainment,us box office set for record high ticket sales at the us box office are predicted to break records this year  with figures expected to reach $9.4 billion  beating 2002 s all-time high.  overall figures could be dampened by the lack of a christmas hit like last year s oscar-winning lord of the rings. traditionally  ticket sales during the festive season account for 20% of the annual total. although admissions have actually fallen this year  the predicted high is down to increasing ticket prices. according to exhibitor relations president paul dergarabedian  the average cost of a cinema ticket could be as high as $6.25 in 2004  compared to $5.80 in 2002. this year some of the biggest hits such as the passion of the christ and fahrenheit 9/11 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters.   many of the films that did well (with audiences) are not necessarily the films that made a lot of money   said mr dergarabedian. he added that surprise hits had come from some of the more art-house offerings such as napoleon dynamite and critical hit sideways. sony pictures  responsible for hits like spiderman 2 and the grudge  are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years  with $1 billion-plus in sales for the third consecutive year. sony pictures entertainment vice chairman. jeff blake said:  we had a really diverse slate this year  and... certainly we pulled off one of the surprises with grudge.  horror movie the grudge cost sony $10 million to make but brought in $110 million. it s the latest in a recent trend for hollywood studios to back the upper and lower ends of the market  whilst ignoring the middle. warner inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around $1.25 billion  with disney at number three.,-2.0905576
1200,sport,tv calls after carroll error spurs boss martin jol said his team were  robbed  at manchester united after pedro mendes  shot clearly crossed the line but was not given.   the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can t we just stop the game and get the decision right   said jol after the 0-0 draw.  but at the end of the day it s so obvious that pedro s shot was over the line it s incredible.  we feel robbed but it s difficult for the linesman and referee to see it.  mendes shot from 50 yards and united goalkeeper roy carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear. jol added:  we are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line  it was a metre inside the goal.  what really annoys me is that we are here in 2005  watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn t told about it.   we didn t play particularly well but i am pleased - even now - with a point  although we should have had three.  mendes could not believe the  goal  was not given after seeing a replay. he said:  my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate.  it was a very nice goal  it was clearly over the line - i ve never seen one so over the line and not given in my career.  it s really  really over. what can you do but laugh about it  it s a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn t count.  it s not every game you score from the halfway line.  manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology.  i think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that s that technology should play a part in the game   ferguson told mutv.  what i was against originally was the time factor in video replays.  but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can t make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.   thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. so you wouldn t be wasting a lot of time.  i think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. i think that would be an opening into a new area of football.  arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology.  when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford  that just reinforces what i feel - there should be video evidence   said wenger.  it s a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.,1.1267858

275,politics,report attacks defence spending the ministry of defence has been criticised over the soaring spending costs and growing delays of its top equipment projects.  a national audit office report on the 20 biggest projects says costs have risen by £1.7bn in the past year. it says there is  little evidence  the mod s performance had improved  despite the introduction of a  smart acquisition  policy six years ago. a senior defence official told the bbc lessons were being learned. the nao s annual report showed the total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach £50bn - 14% higher than originally planned. the total delays amounted to 62 months  with average individual delays rising by three months.  sir john bourn  head of the nao  said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied.  many problems can be traced to the fact that the mod has not spent enough time and resources in the assessment phase   the report says. the nao found that projects launched since the start of the scheme were showing the same worrying tendencies as the older  legacy projects   such as the eurofighter. a senior defence official  speaking to the bbc s defence correspondent paul adams  said that although the figures were still not good enough  the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle. this year s overspend was significantly less than last year s £3.1bn total  and the defence procurement agency - which is responsible for buying defence equipment - was improving.  lord bach  minister for defence procurement  said he was  obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown   but insisted that the defence procurement agency had  undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects . the latest findings follow a string of critical reports issued within the last 12 months  and  according to our correspondent  contain few new surprises. turning around the defence procurement agency  was a little like trying to turn around a super tanker - it takes a very long time indeed   he said. our correspondent said it was the same projects  including the joint strike fighter  the nimrod and a400m aircraft and the type 45 destroyer  which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost over-runs and delay. but he added some projects  such as the c-17 heavy lift aircraft and successor identification friend or foe (siff)  were showing good performances.,-0.69784355
638,politics,could rivalry overshadow election  tony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle.  along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues  they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of britain. it is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift. ian gibson  for example  urged the two men to stop squabbling  declaring:  for goodness sake  sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can.  those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of re-election. tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster - a behind-closed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity.  meanwhile the likes of health secretary john reid and labour peer lord haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue. and they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison. lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planning.  but this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage. they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears. and it matters little whether the rift is real or  as some try to suggest  simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip. few in westminster actually believe that  simply because the evidence appears to contradict it.  for example  the weekend s attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick. even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories  they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments.  mr blair talked about the  new  labour manifesto - a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor  who has long rejected the label. and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year. that claim was repeated in robert peston s book  a book which amply demonstrates this corrosive downing street soap opera is nowhere near its final act.  for his part  mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour re-elected.  the trouble is  both men have fallen short of offering simple  straightforward denials of the central claims. so they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour. the first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere. they started with and are sustained by  friends  of the two men. one only had to listen to the chancellor s friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime minister s apparent attempts to confound mr brown s leadership ambitions. but it is not just public pronouncements from ex-aides.  there are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides. it is no secret in westminster  for example  that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner.  then there are the actions of the men themselves. gordon brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign. the prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with a keynote speech by the chancellor. meanwhile large numbers of backbench mps insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter  which they believe is a media-only obsession  or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry. either way  there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the labour party serious damage. there are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation. but with probably only four months to the next election  that looks like being a particularly difficult trick to pull off.,2.0529487

isn t enough evidence to put them on trial.  lord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties. but thriller writer frederick forsyth tells bbc news of his personal response to the move.    there is a mortal danger aimed at the heart of britain. or so says home secretary charles clarke. my reaction  so what  it is not that i am cynical or just do not care. i care about this country very much.  but in the 66 years that i have been alive  there has not been one hour  of one day  of one month  of one year  when there has not been a threat aimed at us. my point is  the british have always coped without becoming a dictatorship. we have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear; we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat. but that is what the blair government now seeks to do - create a tyranny to defend us from the al-qaeda tyranny.  i was born on 25 august  1938. the mortal threat back then was a scruffy little austrian called adolf hitler. a week after my first birthday  the threat had become reality. we were at war. my father wore a uniform for five years. after 1945 we yearned for peace at last. but in 1946 winston churchill told us - from the baltic to the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across europe. behind the iron curtain  another genocidal psychopath  another threat. josef stalin triggered the cold war  with the berlin blockade in 1948. my whole generation was blighted by it.  we were threatened by the nuclear holocaust  the nuclear wind  the nuclear winter. we built shelters that would have sheltered nothing. we spent our treasure on weapons instead of hospitals. we took silly precautions. some fought it; some marched futilely against it. some pretended it was not there. the cold war lasted 43 years  but we remained a parliamentary democracy. by the early seventies it was terrorism as well. al fatah  black september  red brigades  but most of all for us the ira and the inla. thirty more years; 300 policemen and women  over 600 soldiers  more than 3 000 civilians dead  but we won because even ira bombs could not force us to become a tyranny. that was why the tyrants lost. civil rights were infringed as little as humanly possible. evidence had to be taken in secret to protect covert sources; yes   and one judge  no-jury courts had to be instituted when juries were terrorised. informants had to be given immunity from their own crimes to win the bigger battle. but habeas corpus did not die; right of appeal was not abolished. now the threat is islamic fundamentalism. its leaders want to destroy our society; so did the ira.  it is based and funded abroad; so was the ira. it has sleeper fanatics inside our society; so did the ira. it is extremely hard to penetrate with our agents; so was the ira. the prime movers are not easy to bring to trial; neither were the ira. but we did. and without becoming a tyranny. now the blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism. the citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial  not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge  but the whim of a political activist called a government minister. to be protected from terror the government says  we must become a tyranny. but a tyranny is based on the citizen s terror. this is not victory; this is defeat before a shot is fired.  an interesting article - its good to see widening participation in the debate - but i suggest we move one step further. our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace  because invading foreign nations  imprisoning the innocent and  hunting  in the  shadows  cannot destroy an evil of the mind  and hatred within the heart. rather than focusing upon effect  we should consider the cause  because terrorism does not begin with bombs. why not try a foreign policy of compassion  it can only enhance our democracy  and share our freedom.  i agree with frederick forsyth. we really can t deal with terrorism by turning britain into a fascist state. what we really need is more honesty from our security services and our politicians. if they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial  there probably isn t any. our security services  behave like the detective who having decided that a certain person is guilty  rakes over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it  while the real villain gets away. remember there were no wmd in iraq. just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist.  in this overly  politically correct  society  it is good to see someone like mr. forsyth speak out. yes  there has been oppression by the british government in the past  and overstepping the mark in places like ireland  but yes  we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc. (apart from a number of prisoners in belmarsh goal  for example).this country signs up to human rights  and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear  the innocent people (defined by whom ). when id cards become mandatory  the data collected will not be protected by the data protection act  and will be readily available to people like gchq  with no control by the person whose id is being checked.  the threat now is new. you cannot compare the threats of past years with now. forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in ny on september 11th 2001. the threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology. a kilo of semtex will flatten a building  a kilo of plutonium will flatten a city. you now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible. i agree  the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too.  the problem with this issue is not that it isn t important  but the fact that in general we brits can be so politically apathetic some times  that we will just let this go without telling the government no. however  as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty i hope this will prove to be one step too far.  as somebody of chinese origin  i can say that this country used to be a good place to migrate and start a new life. whilst life wasn t perfect  we could make better for ourselves. now we are riddled with red tape and be told what we can or cannot do. we have to be politically-correct and we are not allowed to have beliefs or opinions. we have a prime minister who spends too much time meddling in us politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of british citizens at home or abroad. mr forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions. let s hope the bbc doesn t get gagged for letting people express their views. the people have the right to know and the bbc s role is to inform  educate and entertain...  i agree. terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear  by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties. in the end  the very thing we seek to protect is what we are giving up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy. the terrorists have already won.  i absolutely agree with frederick forsyth. yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but existing laws seem to be more than adequate. the idea that the  new terrorism  demands new powers is erroneous. the evidence of any real terrorist capability in the uk is scant. ricin  for example  is a dangerous poison but it is not a weapon of mass destruction. what is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.  if the government has its way with id cards  tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not. we will have lost the precious freedom which bush and blair constantly tells us we have and that they seek to bring to others.  i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth. i am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court. that goes right back to magna carta  and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they  knew best .  when you look at today s britain  you realise george orwell was only wrong about one thing: the date.  frederick forsyth puts it beautifully. the government is seeking to introduce a police state. the new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases  together with the un-british idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years. we are sleep-walking into this. wake up!  an interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance. these people will use devastating force against us without fear of any consequence. 2) the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it. because these terrorists are potentially so deadly  we have to come up with new  tougher responses. it will be a little late in the day when people outside london wake up one morning to find out that london has been nuked. we won t have much of a society left to debate !  he s correct in most of what he says. mind you he does seem to have forgotten that disgraceful internment policy in northern ireland which probably caused many idealistic if misguided young catholics to join the ira. administrative detention of muslims could have a similar effect now.  surely we the public would be better protected if the security services  rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long )they were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack.  i don t usually have much time for mr forsyth s largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on. there is no doubt that there are terrorist organisations who would like to do harm to the u.k. but it is very doubtful whether al-qaeda is a global organisation co-ordinating this. the rise of surveillance cameras  id cards  the plan to charge for road use by tracking every vehicle at all times  this is the stuff of nightmares. add to this this new legislation which effectively means that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the home secretary  and i genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit. where will this end. as it stands terrorists do not need to attack the u.k. it s government will soon have it s people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.  mr forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation  but could not verbalise. thank you.  mr forsyth seems to forget that killings in the troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides. he also forgets basic human rights were suspended then as now. experienced judges sat over some of the greatest miscarriages of justice during those times. for very little return and maximum alienation. these laws and the emphasis on the islamic threat will just do the same.  forsyth is wrong. the nature of the current threat is new. it is no longer to our armed forces  as the soviet threat in the eastern bloc was. it is to you and i. the terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately. the best comparison is therefore the blitz  1941. at this time  let us not forget  suspects (foreign and british were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war  without any complaints from the public. we must not forget we are at war.  i d say that that the likelihood of an attack by a sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatics against a major uk target is a  when  not an  if  probability. i ll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government didn t do enough to protect the uk. people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blair.  i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth. the very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live  is under attack  not from terrorists  but from this government. the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the  alleged  terrorists are doing  but from our own government. i believe what this government is doing  is  at the very least  highly questionable and at worst  sinister. at what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the british isles; when we are all tagged and monitored constantly  our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing. it should be of great concern to everyone.  i am slightly older than mr forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him. i am against a police state and would not like to think that i lived in one. i think that the attack on iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further acts of terrorism.  how true. there are extremely worrying parallels between britain now and germany during the 30 s. i never thought it would be so easy to take over a country from within.  mr forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler  stalin  and the ira all failed. as a result modern day terrorists are willing to do things their predecessors did not. that does not mean that the civil liberties of modern britain must be eroded to counter the threat; that should always be the absolute last resort. but to meet the new threat  to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today s terrorists  we may need to do things a little differently. let us hope not.  frederic forsythe s comments seem to me to be a well-thought-out analysis of why we (human society as a whole  and britain in particular) should resist the temptation to over-protect through fear. it is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end  and terrorists can come in all forms  as mr. forsythe s opening comments suggest.  i am reminded of a quote attributed to thomas jefferson.  a nation that limits freedom in the name of security will have neither.   the government are faced with an incredibly difficult task  and have made a policy to deal with it. it s all very well criticising that policy  but if mr forsythe can t draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative  i say  so what   to his opinions.  frederick forsyth s rhetoric is absurd and his conclusions laughable. he distorts reality to serve his own prejudice against new labour. this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights. it is frederick forsyth who is the extremist  because he does not appreciate the need for balance.  i rarely find myself agreeing with my forsyth  but in this instance i think he is correct. the rule of law must prevail  civil liberties are worth defending. if the government can hold  suspects  without charge or trial  what s next   i agree absolutely. by introducing fascist type laws we loose the moral high ground in our fight against terror. our democratic system is not perfect  but as churchill points out it is  better than all the others that have been tried . terrorist attacks will take place but for many reasons we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom.  i do not usually agree with mr. forsyth  but he is spot on here. the single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose. totalitarianism always requires an outside threat  justifying a range of extraordinary powers leaders want. the british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.  although  in principle i agree with him  frederick forsyth fails to address one key point- al-qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the uk) seek to kill the maximum number of people. the ira wanted to limit the death toll of their attacks so as to maintain support among the republican movement.  yes  i agree with mr. forsyth s views. i do not believe the government s plans are justified. there is over reaction to and the negative influence of the us president s interpretation of democracy and freedom. he uses the same arguments that were current before the wwii  the wars to  liberate  iraq  afghanistan with syria and iran to come. we are leaving a poor inheritance for the future generations.  mr forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs. the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests. sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny  even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who  mr. forsyth seems to be putting along side the  scruffy little austrian.   thomas hobbes would be smiling in his grave at labour s propositions. like new labour  he called himself a libertarian. like new labour  he believed he was promoting the people s best interests. but as forsythe criticises this government  hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians. simply put  he argued that in favour of the ultimate liberty - the liberty to live - man should be prepared to surrender all other liberties to a supreme sovereign  as protection against his fellow  barbaric  man. hobbes has been roundly condemned by posterity  and rightly so. i hope new labour suffers the same treatment.  i agree with mr forsyth s views. the governments approach is totally against the spirit of british democracy. they must not be allowed to get away with it.  of course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and he s wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny. has he forgotten about shoot to kill  torture  internment without trial  collusion with loyalist death squads etc   my background is somewhat similar to freddie s so i am persuaded to agree with many of his sentiments. we can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms.  whilst the principle of keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive  it is  unfortunately  also the first step towards totalitarianism. who is to decide whom is a suspect  why should we believe them  who can have faith in the honesty  integrity  and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years  what is to stop false denunciations  what of those falsely accused who will lose their careers  who will support their families  will their children still go to school  it smacks to me of the methods of nazi germany  stalin s russia  ceausescu s romania - the list goes on. it looks as if a new dark age is coming.  i see that opinion on mr forsyth s remarks are divided. the problem i see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family  only to people they don t like or are scared of. but history has shown that if you have laws like that  they always get abused by those in power. after all  today you may be scared of the same people as those in power but someday those in power may be scared of you! and that day  you ll be the one imprisoned without the chance of justice. our laws are such that you cannot just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces  you have to be shown to be deserving of it. if we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period  we are no better that those we are fighting.  i never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by frederick forsyth  but i m in wholehearted agreement with him on this one. we  as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda  which of course also means we ll inherit most  if not all of their total paranoia  and allow our governments  of any political persuasion incidentally  to gradually  and insidiously  impose a police state by well tried & tested back door methods. i grieve for the future of my children  it s no wonder they re adamant they don t ever want any of their own.  this government  with much fanfare  signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial. this puts it on a par with the government of burma.  like many of your respondents  i wouldn t usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share  but in the instance of opposing charles clark s proposals for house arrest  i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth/  i agree with mr forsyth. just look at the facts - our government (along with the us) invaded another sovereign country (iraq) by selecting intelligence that backed it s case based on fear. the facts turned out to be very different. if individuals are treated in the same distorted way  then we ve done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs. we become animals too.  i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent  it is hypocrisy of the highest order. mr forsyth links  islamic fundamentalism  to the new  threat . however it appears that he has misunderstood the term  islamic fundamentalism . it should be pointed out that a muslim who adheres to the true fundamentals of the qur aan and the teachings of the last prophet muhammad is an islamic fundamentalist. this person does not commit suicide in any shape or form  nor does she/he kill innocent women  men and children. this person is self-reflective and constantly tries to better her/his actions by being good to others. the people who mr forsyth labels the new  threat  are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam. they have arrived at their own interpretations and assumptions with regards their actions. on top of that  they claim to be following islam in its true form!  i accept that the intentions of these policies are to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in northern ireland internment certainly didn t achieve anything - the bombings didn t stop  and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the british.  being eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london  it is easy to agree with him  he is absolutely spot on. during the ira bombings there were massive explosions in canary wharf  to the right of where i write this  and also to the left in the city of london. notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on prime minister thatcher in brighton and on later occupants of 10 downing street  there was no retaliatory blitz on belfast or dublin as there has been on afghanistan and iraq. even when england was in true peril in 1940 apart from some detentions there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like. we have to see off these latest attempts on our liberties including id cards  which winston churchill decided had to go since  he said  the average bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activities (incidentally i can still remember my old id card number). hence it is clear that the far too great police state powers set for the statute books have to be resisted and neutered.  what can i add to mr. forsyth s eloquently put arguments... except applause! well done that man for standing up and being counted in the  war against tyranny .,-0.7997923
514,tech,net regulation  still possible  the blurring of boundaries between tv and the internet raises questions of regulation  watchdog ofcom has said.  content on tv and the internet is set to move closer this year as tv-quality video online becomes a norm. at a debate in westminster  the net industry considered the options. lord currie  chairman of super-regulator ofcom  told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. despite having no remit for the regulation of net content  disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. at the debate  organised by the internet service providers  association (ispa)  lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation.   the challenge will arise when boundaries between tv and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves   he said. adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or self-regulation  which is currently the practice of the net industry  will be up for discussion.  some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the uk could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005  and the technology opens the door to tv content delivered over the net. more and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. bt has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as bskyb  itv and the bbc. head of the division  andrew burke  spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms.  how risque can i be in this new age  with celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners  surely i can push it to the limit   he said.  in fact  he said  if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it  then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the law commission dubbed them  mere conduits  back in 2002. this defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it. the level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases. richard ayers  portal director at tiscali  said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. huge changes are afoot in 2005  he predicted  as companies such as the bbc offer tv content over the net. the bbc s planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as eastenders and top gear will make net tv mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions  he said.  one of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee  said mr ayers. as inappropriate net content  most obviously pornography viewed by children  continues to dominate the headlines  internet regulation remains a political issue said mp richard allan  liberal democrat spokesman on it. mr allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of  impossible to regulate  and  just apply offline laws online . in fact  instead of seeing regulation brought online  the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all tv content. after lord currie departed  the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign.  if content is on-demand  consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them  then it is the consumers  choice to watch it. there is no watershed on the net   said mr burke.,-2.0181222

2169,politics,goldsmith denies war advice claim the attorney general has denied his statement to parliament about the legality of the iraq war was drafted by downing street officials.  lord goldsmith said lord falconer and baroness morgan played no part in drafting the answer. he added the answer represented his view that the war was legal  but was not a summary of his advice to the pm. the government has resisted calls to publish the full advice  saying such papers are always kept confidential.  in a statement  lord goldsmith said:  i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised  and of course approved  the answer.  he said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of solicitor general harriet harman  two of his own officials  three foreign office officials  a qc  christopher greenwood and the then lord chancellor  lord irvine of lairg.   no other minister or official was involved in any way.  he suggested the claim that lord falconer and lady morgan had drafted the answer were the result of a mis-transcription of his evidence to the butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence.  as i have always made clear  i set out in the answer my own genuinely held  independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (un) security council resolutions   he said.  the answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government.  former foreign secretary robin cook said lord goldsmith s admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested parliament may have been misled.  the attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary  but others certainly did   he said.  what is clear from his statement today is that he does not believe that it was a full  accurate summary of his formal opinion.   earlier  tony blair dismissed questions about the attorney general s advice  and said his parliamentary statement had been a  fair summary  of his opinion.  that s what he (lord goldsmith) said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again   mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue.  on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential  tory mp michael mates  who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry  told the bbc:  that  as a general rule  is right  but it s not an absolute rule.  he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published  most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention  he said. mr mates added:  this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.   the claims about lord falconer and baroness morgan s involvement were made in a book published this week by philippe sands qc  a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers. he also says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action.  a short statement about lord goldsmith s position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this. former minister clare short  who resigned from the government over the iraq war  said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. she said the full advice should have been attached  according to the ministerial code  and demanded a lords inquiry into the matter. the conservatives and liberal democrats say they still want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. lib dem foreign affairs spokesman sir menzies campbell said lord goldsmith s statement still did not clear up the outstanding issues.  if his original advice of 7 march accepted that military action might be illegal  how was it that he resolved any such doubts by the time the parliamentary answer was published on 17 march   he said.  only the fullest disclosure will now do.,1.559356
1335,tech,musicians  upbeat  about the net musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music  a survey has found.  the study by us researchers  pew internet  suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file-sharing. while most considered file-sharing as illegal  many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders.  even successful artists don t think the lawsuits will benefit musicians   said report author mary madden.  for part of the study  pew internet conducted an online survey of 2 755 musicians  songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between march and april 2004.  they ranged from full-time  successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music.  we looked at more of the independent musicians  rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry   ms madden told the bbc news website.  we always hear the views of successful artists like the britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented.  the survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet  rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood. almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration  with nine out of 10 going online to promote  advertise and post their music on the web. more than 80% offered free samples online  while two-thirds sold their music via the net. independent musicians  in particular  saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly.  musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically   said ms madden.  they are using the internet to gain inspiration  sell it online  tracking royalties  learning about copyright.   perhaps surprisingly  opinions about online file-sharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry.  through the recording industry association of america (riaa)  it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music. but the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the us. it found that most artists saw file-sharing as both good and bad  though most agreed that it should be illegal.  free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing   said one musician quoted by the report.  it s hard to keep making records if they don t pay for themselves through sales.  however 60% said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters. many suggested that rather than fighting file-sharing  the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it.  both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music  rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy   said ms madden.,-1.0115652
178,business,yukos owner sues russia for $28bn the majority owner of embattled russian oil firm yukos has sued the russian government for $28.3bn (£15.2bn).  the kremlin last year seized and sold yukos  main production arm  yugansk  to state-run oil group rosneft for $9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. group menatep  the gibraltar-based holding company which controls 51% of yukos  says this was illegal. menatep has already asked rosneft to repay a $900m loan that yugansk had secured on its assets.  the russian government s argument for selling yuganskneftegaz - the unit s full name - was that yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. it accused the firm of using a web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities  and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze yukos accounts and seize yugansk.  but critics say the sell-off  and the assault on yukos  finances  are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. according to menatep  the government s actions were contrary to the 1994 energy charter treaty  which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments.  we have warned the russian government about their continuing attacks against yukos  its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation   said tim osborne  a director of group menatep.  the time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today.   menatep said the value of its yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to  virtually nothing  since 2003 as a result of the russian government s action  as its shares have fallen 97%. according to its paris lawyer  emmanuel gaillard of shearman and sterling  the overall claim is based on that figure  with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in stockholm or the hague  mr gaillard said. while russia has signed the charter  it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for menatep to press its case. but mr gaillard told bbc news that the charter came into effect on signature  not ratification.  russia has said in the past that it is bound by it  so as to attract foreign investors   he said.  yukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in a us court for bankruptcy protection. it took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of yugansk - first to a little-known shell company  which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky  currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own  was one of the founders of menatep. he has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors.,0.89154387
1453,tech,broadband set to revolutionise tv bt is starting its push into television with plans to offer tv over broadband.  as a telecoms company  bt is moving to a content distribution strategy  andrew burke  chief of bt s new entertainment unit told the iptv world forum.  we want to be an entertainment facilitator   he said on the opening day of the london conference. the bbc is also trialling a service to play programmes over the net and has not ruled out offering it to non-licence fee payers overseas. the corporation s interactive media player (imp) is its first foray into broadband tv - known as iptv (internet protocol tv).   we see several opportunities for delivering the type of content that normally broadcasters find it difficult to get to viewers   said bt s andrew burke.  with more people on broadband  and connection speeds increasing  telcos around the world are looking for new ways to make money from it. increased competition between net service providers  encouraged by ofcom  has eroded bt s position in the market. it is looking for a good return on its investment in the technology which has made broadband over adsl a reality. it also sees delivering tv over broadband as a way of getting high-definition (hd) content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional  regular broadcasts. the bbc s imp has just finished successful technical trials and is set for much larger consumer trials later in 2005. before it officially launches  the bbc must show the government how it offers value for money. delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value  says the bbc  because it gives people more control  and more choice.  iptv is a similar idea to voip services  like skype. both use broadband net connections to carry information  like video and voice  in packets of data instead of conventional means. since it uses internet technology  iptv could mean more choice of programmes  more  more interactivity  tailored programming  and more localised content outside of conventional satellite  digital cable  and terrestrial broadcasts.  it is all part of the larger changing tv technology landscape and  like personal digital video recorders (pvrs)  gives people much more control over tv. broadcasters see iptv and pvrs as both as a threat and an opportunity. the bbc recognises that tv over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it  said rahul chakkara  controller of bbci s 24/7 interactive tv services. the imp is based on peer-to-peer technology  and lets people download programmes the bbc owns the rights to for up to seven days after broadcast.  iptv enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times   said mr chakkara.   so we can tell our audience that that programme they paid for [via the licence fee]  they can access it any time they want.  it helps  said mr burke  that people are more au fait with terms like  digital    interactive   now that digital tv reaches more than 56% of uk homes. according to benoit joly from broadband telecoms firm thales  30% of europe cannot get satellite tv or digital tv. they could get iptv though. analysts say that iptv will account for 10% of the digital tv market in europe alone by the end of the decade. what needs to happen now  agree analysts  is for connection speeds to be bumped up to handle the service; 20mbps connections would be ideal. bt does not see itself as a broadcaster of iptv services  rather as an  enabler   said mr burke. its strategy is a  hybrid  approach  he explained  where over-the-air conventional broadcasts are supplemented with content over broadband.  initially appealing to niche markets  like sports fans  it will widen out. but iptv could be used for home-monitoring   pet cams   localised news services  and local authority tv  too says bt. it even suggests that it could target those households in the uk that do not own a computer  40% of the country.  broadband to them would not be about data and the net - that could come later for them - but about cheap phone calls and more choice of tv programmes. home choice already offers 10 000 hours of shows and channels  delivered over broadband to homes in london. with a broadband net subscription  you can also get your tv and phone service. through content deals and partnerships  it offers satellite as well as terrestrial channels  and bespoke channels based on what viewers pick and choose from its catalogues. it aims to expand nationally  but is seeing a lot of success with what it offers its 15 000 subscribers now  and aims to double uptake as well as reach by the summer. although still at a very early stage  iptv is another application for broadband that underlines its growing prominence as a backbone network - another utility like electricity.,1.2241511
951,politics,csa chief who  quit  still in job the head of the  failing  child support agency widely reported to have resigned three months ago is still at the helm of the troubled organisation.  doug smith s departure was announced by work secretary alan johnson on 17 november as mps grilled him over the agency s poor performance. his  resignation  was referred to by both tory and lib dem leaders during that day s prime ministers questions. officials now say he did not resign but will move on under civil service rules.  mr smith s departure was reported widely at the time as his shouldering the blame for the failings of the child support agency. in january the mps who make up the commons work and pensions committee published a highly critical report into the  failing  agency noting the chief executive  has now left  and hoping  the new leadership will bring a fresh approach to what is a failing organisation .  on that day s today programme mr johnson was asked why mr smith had been allowed to resign rather than be sacked. he replied:  the chief executive decided it was time to move on  there is a new chief executive coming in.  it now emerges that the widespread belief mr smith  made commander of the order of the bath in the new year honours  had left  was wrong. a department for work and pensions spokeswoman confirmed mr smith was still in post and that he would continue in the job until a replacement was found.  no date was ever given for doug smith s departure   she said adding that the post had been advertised.  tory work and pensions spokesman david willetts said families affected by csa failings would wonder why mr smith was still in his job three months after his departure was announced. the csa has been surrounded by controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents.  the work and pensions committee launched their inquiry into the csa s performance after it became clear that  despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003  a backlog of claims was still building up. it is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than £720m  while a further £947m has been designated as  unrecoverable . the mps found american it giant eds  £456m system was  nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied  disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate .  in november  when he surprised mps and the watching media by announcing mr smith s departure  mr johnson said:  i should tell you that doug has decided that now is the time to stand aside and to allow a new chief executive to tackle the challenges ahead.  doug has exceeded the four years that senior civil servants are now expected to remain in a particular post.  so doug believes that we have reached the natural breakpoint at which he can hand over the reins.  lib dem sir archy kirkwood  who chairs the commons work and pensions committee  said that when mr johnson had announced mr smith was going he got the  clear impression  the csa chief was retiring though it had since emerged that was not the case  and he may be seeking new employment opportunities.  he added his committee was  duty bound  to allow the work and pensions secretary to get new management into place in the csa and it would be  premature  to say anything further on the issue at the moment. but committee member and tory mp nigel waterson said he was  amazed  mr smith was still in his job.  when mr smith and the secretary of state came to give evidence  we were led to believe he was going shortly   he said.  even if he was working out three months notice  he should have been clearing his desk by now.  asked on thursday about mr smith s position mr johnson told bbc radio 4 s world at one he thought it was a  non-story . he added that he had been absolutely open when he announced mr smith s departure to the select committee and how people chose to interpret it was a  different thing .  the major issue is have we got a new chief executive coming into this very important agency as quickly as possible and have we gone through the right selection process to make sure we ve got the right people   he added.,1.6623001
494,sport,arnesen denies rift with santini tottenham sporting director frank arnesen has denied that coach jacques santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at white hart lane.  there had been newspaper speculation that santini had felt undermined by arnesen s role at the club.  it is absolutely not true   arnesen told bbc radio five live.  there is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems.  he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself.  arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just 13 games in charge. he added:  jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. but i trust him in that; you have to accept it. i think we should respect it.   the plan is now that over the weekend we will have talks with the board and then on monday we will clarify the situation.  arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement  coming less than 24 hours before tottenham s premiership fixture with charlton.  when it comes down to personal problems  i don t think we should talk about timing   he said. and he also denied reports that santini had been given a £3m pay-off.  that is absolute nonsense. he is the one who said  i will go  and so he went    said the spurs sporting director. tottenham s structure of having a sporting director working alongside a coach is based on a continental model and arnesen sees no reason why they should change it.   i have confidence in this structure. i am confident that we have started something here in july and i still have a lot of confidence in tottenham and what we are doing   he said. however  former spurs and england defender gary stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused a rift.  i think the problems go a lot deeper  between the director of football at white hart lane and santini   stevens told five live.  on paper they could have worked together. but frank arnesen was a very creative  forward-thinking and expansive player - whereas i think santini was very much the opposite  more a case of being organised  disciplined and happy not conceding goals.  that sort of arrangement can work if the two people have the same principles and ideals and work very closely. but it seems that has not happened.,1.3939793

1728,sport,wales make two changes for france wales coach mike ruddock has made two changes from the team that beat italy 38-8 for saturday s trip to france.  kevin morgan takes over from his injured newport-gwent dragons colleague hal luscombe on the right wing. and in the pack neath-swansea ospreys forward ryan jones is preferred at blindside flanker to jonathan thomas. thomas  a try-scorer in rome  drops down to the bench instead of ian gough  while cardiff back rhys williams steps up in place of morgan. luscombe is sidelined by a hamstring problem sustained during the six nations game against italy last weekend.  however  the experienced and in-form morgan was already pushing hard for a start at stade de france.  due to his impressive performances from the bench  kevin was very much in the selection mix anyway  and the unfortunate injury to hal gives him the chance to start   said ruddock.  now that ryan jones has recovered from injury  we have increased the options in the back row.  jonathan thomas is unlucky to lose his spot after performing well against italy and scoring a try  but such is the competition for places that every position is debated in detail.  for this particular game  we felt we might not always be afforded the open spaces out wide we were able to exploit against italy  so an extra big ball-carrier in the back-row is thought to be necessary on this occasion.  obviously  it s a 22-man game these days  and there is every chance that jonathan will be making an impact from the bench.  wales have beaten france on two of their last three visits to paris  and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for a first five or six nations title triumph since 1994.  graham henry (former wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should  be bold  when going to france  and he was proved right   said ruddock.  that is a great way to approach the game  and something we will further endorse with the players this week.   g thomas (toulouse  capt); k morgan (newport-gwent)  t shanklin (cardiff)  g henson (neath-swansea)  s williams (neath-swansea); s jones (clermont auvergne)  d peel (llanelli); g jenkins (cardiff)  m davies (gloucester)  a jones; (neath-swansea)  b cockbain (neath-swansea)  r sidoli (cardiff); r jones (neath-swansea)  m williams (cardiff)  m owen (newport-gwent).  replacements: r mcbryde (llanelli)  j yapp (cardiff)  j thomas (neath-swansea)  r sowden-taylor (cardiff)  g cooper (newport-gwent)  c sweeney newport-gwent)  r williams (cardiff).,0.7212162
2136,politics,fido  to be taken off vote lists the risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote  the uk elections watchdog has said.  those are some of the mistakes found under the current system  where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants. the electoral commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud. voters need to register by 11 march if the next poll is on 5 may as expected. but any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in britain before that general election.  the proposed scheme would mean voters using individual  identifiers  when they vote - such as their own voting number  date of birth and signature. the electoral commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws. chairman sam younger told mps on tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when northern ireland switched to a similar system. there have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll  the mps heard. and some people have registered all their family  regardless of their age - birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check. non-british citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases.  mr younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register  the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes. he argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at  hard to reach  voters  for example. some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out. mr younger said using the royal mail s postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50 000 voters.  he argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting. there have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form. he said it might also help register students in halls of residences  where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody. the mps on the office of the deputy prime minister and constitutional affairs select committees pressed mr younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover. he said the northern ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted. currently  british voters have to re-register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running. mr younger suggested the re-registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up-to-date.,0.39488745

887,politics,minister defends hunting ban law the law banning hunting with dogs in england and wales is enforceable and  very clear   alun michael has said.  the rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law  which came into force on friday  and pretended they were not. some 270 hunts met legally on saturday killing a total of 91 foxes - only four were accidentally killed by hounds. but anti-hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts. countryside alliance chairman john jackson said that saturday had been a  massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting . people had turned out  to show en masse that the hunting act was a bad law   he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed  legally  as far as he was aware.  although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence  exercising hounds  chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable  mr michael told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  there has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting.  the reality is that the law is very clear. you can t chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs  whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer.  if people do so and pretend they re not it s going to become very clear. you can t hunt accidentally.  mr michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities. he said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy  the health service and their children s future than hunting.  but the league against cruel sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen. thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across england and wales on the first day of the ban  with anti-hunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken. there were only four arrests - over alleged hunting of hares in wiltshire - although it was not clear whether they were made under the hunting act.  they have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws. but penny little  who monitored the bicester hunt in oxfordshire  said she had witnessed  gratuitous  spiteful killing of foxes . if people tried to  run circles around this law  the only outcome would be that it was tightened up  she said. mike hobday  from the league against cruel sports  said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police. he said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti-hunt activists videoing hunts. but mr jackson  who had been at the bicester hunt in oxfordshire  denied there was any intimidation.,-0.114750385
699,politics,eu china arms ban  to be lifted  the eu embargo on arms exports to china is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite us objections  uk foreign secretary jack straw has said.  the 15-year-old ban was imposed in the aftermath of china s crackdown on protesters in tiananmen square. mr straw told a commons select committee human rights concerns over china remained. but he said it was wrong to put china under the same embargo as countries such as zimbabwe and burma.  in december  the eu pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. the eu s move was welcomed at the time by beijing  which described the embargo as a  product of the cold war . german chancellor gerhard schroeder and french president jacques chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. britain has been more cautious on the issue  but on wednesday mr straw said he also wanted it to end.  i have long understood china s argument  that to lump them in with  say  burma and zimbabwe is not appropriate and i don t think it is   he told the joint committee on strategic export controls. he said  it is more likely than not  that the ban would be lifted before britain takes over the presidency of the eu from luxembourg in july. but he said an eu code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country.  if it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to china as we have now.   mr straw said the us government was suspicious of  the motives of some other countries within the eu  in wanting the ban lifted. but he said many of washington s objections were based on a  lack of information and understanding  of how export control guidelines worked in eu countries. and  intense discussions  were taking place with us officials to convince them it was the right thing to do. washington is thought to fear it would lead to a buying spree for arms that could be used by china to threaten its diplomatic rival taiwan. us officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the eu code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses. us undersecretary of state john bolton is meeting british officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo.,3.3075252

455,tech,uk net users leading tv downloads british tv viewers lead the trend of illegally downloading us shows from the net  according to research.  new episodes of 24  desperate housewives and six feet under  appear on the web hours after they are shown in the us  said a report. web tracking company envisional said 18% of downloaders were from within the uk and that downloads of tv programmes had increased by 150% in the last year. about 70% were using file-sharing program bittorrent  the firm said.  it s now as easy to download a pirate tv show as it is to programme a vcr   said ben coppin from envisional. a typical episode of 24 was downloaded by about 100 000 people globally  said the report  and an estimated 20 000 of those were from within the uk.  fans of many popular us tv programmes  like 24  usually have to wait weeks or months until the latest series is shown in the uk. but in some cases  said the report  people were able to watch the new episodes in britain before us audiences on the west coast of the country.  missing a television show presents little problem to anyone with a basic knowledge of the internet   explained mr coppin.   two clicks and your favourite programme is downloading. in effect  the internet is now a global video recorder.  exact figures are difficult to pin down  but it is thought that about 80 000 to 100 000 people in the uk download tv programmes. some may just want the odd episode  others are downloading regularly. many broadcast analysts agree that the net is radically altering the way people get content  like tv programmes. this presents a challenge to broadcasters who are concerned that channel schedules may become less important to people. it is also of concern to them because advertisements are usually cut out of the downloaded programmes. the industry has coined the term  time-shifting  to describe this trend of being able to watch what you want  when you want. the increased popularity of personal digital video recorders  tivo-type boxes which automatically record programmes like sky+  have also contributed to the trend. there are also numerous programs available on the net which automatically search and store tv programmes for viewers  effectively creating a personal video recorder on a computer.  within half an hour  recorded episodes can be uploaded - or posted - onto file-sharing networks or other download sites. because they tend to be shorter then full-length films  they can be processed - digitised - quickly. more people with high-speed broadband connections in the uk also means that episodes can be downloaded quickly.  according to jupiter research 40% of homes with broadband say it helps them pick and choose the programmes they want to see or that friends have recommended. the envisional reports said that the tv industry should consider offering a legal way to download shows. the bbc ran a trial of what it calls the interactive media player (imp) last year  which was based on a peer-to-peer distribution model. it let people download programmes it held the rights to up to eight days after they had already aired. it is looking to do a more expansive trial later this year. the bbc already allows radio fans to hear programmes they missed online up to a week after broadcast. about six million people in the uk now have a fast  always-on net connection via cable or phone lines.,-0.58774567

in seville. spain lead 1-0 after carlos moya beat mardy fish in straight sets in the opening match of the tie.  nadal holds his nerve and the crowd goes wild as spain go 2-0 up in the tie.  roddick holds serve to force nadal to serve for the match but the american surely cannot turn things around now.  nadal works roddick around the court on two consecutive points to earn two break points. one is enough  the spaniard secures the double-break and roddick is now teetering on the edge.  roddick is trying to gee himself up but the clay surface is taking its toll on his game and he is looking tired. nadal wins the game to love.  nadal steps up the pressure to break and spain have the early initiative in the fourth set.  nadal also holds convincingly as both players feel their way into the fourth set.  roddick shrugs off the disappointment of losing the third-set tiebreak and breezes through his first service game of the fourth set.  nadal earns the first mini-break in the tiebreak as the match enters its fourth hour. a couple of stunning points follow  one where nadal chases down a roddick shot and turns into a passing winner. then roddick produces some amazing defence at the net to take the score to 4-4. roddick has two serves for the set but double-faults to take the score to 5-5. nadal saves a roddick set point then earns his own with a drive volley - and a crosscourt passing winner sends the crowd wild.  nadal tries to up his aggression and he passes roddick down the line to go 15-40 and two set points up. roddick saves the first with a desperate lunge volley and smacks a volley winner across the court to take the score back to deuce before securing the game. the set will go to another tiebreak.  nadal enjoys another straightforward hold and roddick must once again serve to stay in the set.  roddick again holds on  despite some brilliant shot-making from his opponent.  nadal races through his service game to put the pressure straight back onto roddick.  roddick hangs in on his serve to level matters but nadal is making him fight for every point.  nadal could be suffering a disappointment hangover from the previous game as he goes 0-30 down and then has to save a break point after a tremendous rally in which he is forced into some brilliant defence. but it pays off and the spaniard edges ahead in the set.  roddick s serve is not firing as ferociously as usual and has to rely on his sheer competitive determination to stay in the set. three times  nadal forces a break point and three times the world number two hangs in. and roddick s grit pays off as he manages to hold.  roddick still looks a bit sluggish but he attacks the net and is rewarded with a break point  which nadal saves with a good first serve and the spaniard goes on to hold.  there is a disruption in play as roddick is upset about something in the crowd. the spanish captain gets involved as does the match referee but it is unclear what the problem is. one thing for certain is that the crowd are roused into support of nadal and they go wild when roddick loses the next point and goes break point down. roddick saves the break point and then bangs down his ninth ace before clinching the game with a service winner.  the game passes the two-hour mark as nadal holds serve to edge ahead in the third set.  now roddick has to defend a break point and he produces a characteristic ace to save it. it is immediately followed by another and he holds with a little dinked half-volley winner.  roddick is looking a little leaden-footed but does carve out a break point for himself. but he plays it poorly and nadal avoids the danger.  roddick has gone off the boil and again struggles. he fails to get down properly for a low forehand volley and gives nadal three break points. the american blasts an ace to save one but follows up with a double fault and the rubber is level.  nadal edges towards taking the second set with a comfortable hold.  two good serves put roddick 30-0 up but he then makes a couple of errors to find himself 30-40 down. he saves the break point with an ace and then manages to hold.  roddick s level has dropped while nadal is on a hot streak. the spaniard includes a superb crosscourt winner off the back foot as he races through his service game without dropping a point.  roddick double-faults twice and nadal takes full advantage of the break point offered  powering a passing winner past roddick.  nadal wins another tight game. neither player has dipped from the high standard of play in the first set.  nadal puts the american under pressure and roddick saves a break point with a superb stop volley before going on to hold.  nadal puts the disappointment of losing the first-set tiebreak to claim the opening game in the second.  roddick double-faults to concede the first mini-break and then nadal loops a crosscourt winner to seize advantage in the tiebreak. he lets one slip but wins his next serve to earn three set points. but roddick saves them and then earns one himself. nadal comes up with a down-the-line winner but then nets tamely on roddick s next set point.  nadal s nerve is tested as he tries to force a tiebreak. both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide.  a pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any easy points. the point of the match so far involves roddick s slam-dunk smash being returned by nadal before roddick finally manages to end the rally. on the very next point  nadal blasts a forehand service return from right of court that passes roddick and even the american is forced to applaud. but roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game.  nadal outplays roddick to reach 40-0 but the american fights back to 40-30 before nadal s powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game.  the crowd are getting very involved  cheering between roddick s first and second serves. but the american comes through to hold and edge ahead in the set.  nadal manages to hold again despite roddick piling the pressure on his serve. the spaniard wins the game courtesy of another lucky net cord.  roddick double faults buts manages to keep his composure. a well-placed serve is unreturnable and roddick holds.  a powerful ace down the middle gives nadal a simple love service game - the first time he has held serve so far in the match. if roddick didn t know before  he knows now that he is in a real contest.  another superb game as nadal breaks to once again lift the roof. he produces some fine groundstrokes to leave roddick chasing shadows. four of the first five games have seen a break of serve.  despite the disappointment of losing his serve  roddick is not phased and storms into a 40-15 lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm a close line-call. nadal takes the next point but roddick breaks again

2173,tech,mobile tv tipped as one to watch scandinavians and koreans  two of the most adventurous groups of mobile users  are betting on mobile tv.  anders igels  chief executive of nordic operator teliasonera  tipped it as the next big thing in mobile in a speech at the 3gsm world congress  a mobile trade fair  in cannes this week. nokia  the finnish handset maker  is planning a party in singapore this spring to launch its tv to mobile activities in the region. consultancy strategy analytics of boston estimates that mobile broadcast networks will have acquired around 51 million users worldwide by 2009  producing around $6.6bn (£3.5bn) in revenue.  sk telecom of south korea  which is launching a tv to mobile service (via satellite) in may plans to charge a flat fee of $12 a month for its 12 channels of video and 12 channels of audio. it will be able to offer an additional two pay tv channels using conditional access technology. mr shin-bae kim  chief executive of sk telecom  also at 3gsm  said:  we have plans to integrate tv with mobile internet services.   this will enable viewers to access the mobile internet to get more information on adverts they see on tv.  there will be 12 handsets available for the launch of the korean service. lg electronics of south korea was demonstrating one at 3gsm that could display video at 30 frames a second. footage shown on the handset was clear and watchable. a speech on mobile tv by angel gambino of the bbc also drew a large crowd  suggesting that even those mobile operators and equipment vendors which are not particularly active in mobile tv yet are starting to look into it.  but all is not simple and straightforward in the mobile tv arena. there is a battle for supremacy between two competing standards: dvb-h for digital video broadcasting for handsets and dmb for digital multimedia broadcasting. dr chan yeob yeun  vice president and research fellow in charge of mobile tv at lg electronics  said:  dmb offers twice the number of frames a minute as dvb-h and does not drain mobile batteries as quickly.  the japanese  koreans and ericsson of sweden are backing dmb.  samsung of south korea has a dmb phone too that will be one of those offered to users of the tu media satellite mobile tv service to be launched in korea in may. nokia  by contrast  is backing dvb-h  and is involved in mobile tv trials that use its art-deco style media phone  which has a larger than usual screen for tv or visual radio (a way of accompanying a radio programme with related text and pictures). mobile operators o2 and vodafone are among the operators trialling mobile tv. but even if the standards battle is resolved  there is the thorny issue of broadcasting rights. ms gambino says the bbc now negotiates mobile rights when it is negotiating content.  for those not convinced mobile users will want to watch tv on their handsets  digital audio broadcasting may provide a good compromise and better sound quality than conventional radio. developments in this area are continuing. at a dab conference in cannes  several makers of dab chips for mobiles announced smaller  lower- cost chips which consume less power. among the chip companies present were frontier silicon and radioscape. the jury is still out on whether tv and digital radio on mobiles will make much money for anyone. but with many new services going live soon  it won t be long before the industry finds out.,1.4249222

751,tech,us blogger fired by her airline a us airline attendant suspended over  inappropriate images  on her blog - web diary - says she has been fired.  ellen simonetti  known as queen of the sky  wrote an anonymous semi-fictional account of her life in the sky. she was suspended by delta in september. in a statement  she said she was initiating legal action against the airline for  wrongful termination . a delta spokesperson confirmed on wednesday that ms simonetti was no longer an employee. delta has repeatedly declined to elaborate on what it calls  internal employee matters . a spokesperson reiterated this position on wednesday  confirming only that ms simonetti was no longer with the company. the spokesperson also confirmed that there were  very clear rules  attached to the unauthorised use of delta branding  including uniforms. ms simonetti announced on her blog she had been fired on 1 november.  she said in an official statement:  as a result of my suspension and subsequent termination without cause by delta airlines i am moving forward with filing a discrimination complaint with the federal government eeoc [us equal employment opportunity commission].  she added she had also hired a texas-based law firm to initiate legal action for  wrongful termination  defamation of character and lost future wages.  ms simonetti told the bbc news website she had received no warning or further explanation when she was suspended on 25 september. queen of the sky has received a lot of support and advice from the global blogging community since news of her suspension was brought to light on the bbc news website and others.  her story has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest  employment law and free speech on personal websites. the blog  which she started in january as a way of getting over her mother s death  contains a mix of fictional and non-fictional accounts. queen of the sky developed over the months as a character in her own right  according to ms simonetti. in the postings  she made up fictional names for cities and other companies she mentioned to protect anonymity. but some postings contained images of herself in uniform. of the 10 or so images only one showed ms simonetti s flight  wings . she removed them as soon as she was informed of her suspension.  i never meant it as something to harm my company and don t understand how they think it did harm them   ms simonetti said. a legal expert in the us speculated that delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images were posted.  delta has been hit recently by pressures of rising fuel costs and fierce competition. it has said it needs to cut between 6 000 and 7 000 jobs and reduce costs by $5bn (£2.7bn) a year. analysts had warned recently that the airline might have to seek chapter 11 bankruptcy prevention. last week  it struck a $1bn cost-cutting deal with its pilots which could save it from bankruptcy. the deal would see pilots accept a 32% pay cut in return for the right to buy 30 million delta shares  unions said. and on monday  it negotiated a deal to defer about $135m in debt which was due next year  until 2007. the airline also said it had agreed the terms of a $600m loan from american express.,-3.354866
2001,business,china continues rapid growth china s economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004  faster than predicted and well above 2003 s 9.1%.  the news may mean more limits on investment and lending as beijing tries to take the economy off the boil. china has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion  which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats. but officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed  with services providing much of the impetus. growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004  down from 17% the previous year.  still  consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004  adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. and overall investment in fixed assets was still high  up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. the result could be higher interest rates. china raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in october 2004.  despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong  economists said.  there is no sign of a slowdown in 2005   said tim congdon  economist at ing barings.  china s economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand  but also from soaring sales overseas. figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004  up 35%. part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan  china s currency. the government keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the us dollar  - much to the chagrin of many us lawmakers who blame china for lost jobs and competitiveness. despite urging to ease the peg  officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate.  we need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time   national bureau of statistics chief li deshui told reuters.  those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.,0.5326085

2065,tech,microsoft launches its own search microsoft has unveiled the finished version of its home-grown search engine.  the now formally launched msn search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in november 2003. the revamped engine indexes more pages than before  can give direct answers to factual questions  and features tools to help people create detailed queries. microsoft faces challenges establishing itself as a serious search site because of the intense competition for queries.  google still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query  keep up with news or search for images. but in the last year google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals  such as yahoo and microsoft  and new entrants such as amazon and blinkx  try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves. this renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information - be it for a particular web page  recipe  book  gadget  news story  image or anything else. microsoft is keen to make its home-grown search engine a significant rival to google. to generate its corpus of data  microsoft has indexed 5 billion webpages and claims to update its document index every two days - more often than rivals. the microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer.  for its direct answer feature  microsoft is calling on its encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions  facts  calculations  conversions and solutions to equations. tony macklin  director of product at ask jeeves  pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since april 2003.  the major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search  so in many ways microsoft is following the market   he said. tools sitting alongside the msn search engine allow users to refine results to specific websites  countries  regions or languages. microsoft is also using so-called  graphic equalisers  that let people adjust the relevance of terms to get results that are more up-to-date or more popular. the company said that user feedback from earlier test versions had been used to refine the workings of the finished system. the test  or beta  version of the msn search engine unveiled in november had a few teething troubles. on its first day many new users keen to try it were greeted with a page that said the site had been overwhelmed.,1.8541384

567,politics,brown hits back in blair rift row gordon brown has criticised a union leader who said conflict between himself and tony blair was harming the workings of government.  jonathan baume  of the top civil servants  union  spoke of  competing agendas  between mr brown and mr blair. but the chancellor said mr baume was never at meetings between himself and the prime minister so could not judge. he said the union leader was trying to block civil service reform which threatened his members  jobs. it suited the purpose of mr baume s union  the first division association  to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms  mr brown told bbc radio 4 s today programme.  under the plans  unveiled in the gershon report  some 84 000 civil servants jobs will be axed or changed and the savings ploughed back into frontline services. mr brown said:  to be honest i don t think you can rely on his [mr baume s] judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making.  mr blair and i are making exactly the same decisions on civil service reforms. we are determined to go on with the gershon reforms.  he also said that as mr baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister  he was not in a position to judge. on wednesday  ahead of the chancellor s pre-budget report  mr baume told bbc news there were sometimes  conflicting and competing agendas for government  between number 10 and the treasury.  what the chancellor wanted was  not by any means what alan milburn and the prime minister want to see   mr baume said.  government departments get their money from the treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to  but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and that s not necessarily the same as the treasury s and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government.  he also sends instructions and messages and directions to departments about how he would like each secretary of state and each department to implement a policy agenda.  the problem is that on many occasions these two don t add up and individual cabinet ministers as well as departments have to make sense of this battle.  number 10 said ministers were interested in governing and not a  soap opera  about mr blair and mr brown. tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin said:  the battle royal that the top civil servants are now reporting on between the chancellor and tony blair is preventing them both from getting on with the business of getting taxpayers value for money.,0.8592572
2026,politics,job cuts  false economy   - tuc plans to shed 71 000 civil service jobs will prove to be a  false economy  that could hamper public sector reforms  according to a tuc report.  public and commercial services union members have already voted to strike over cuts for one day on 5 november. the tuc said cuts would deliver less than 6% of the £22bn ministers hope to save through efficiency reforms. general secretary brendan barber warned the  costs could easily outweigh the benefits .  the government s big boost to public spending is now showing results   said mr barber.  public services are improving but looking for simple savings through job cuts at this stage could be a false economy.   they may shoot a tory fox  but cutting thousands of civil service jobs will hit the morale and capabilities of the public servants expected to implement government reforms. the costs could easily outweigh the benefits.  next friday s strike action by the pcs is the biggest in the civil service since 1993  hitting jobcentres  benefit agencies  pensions offices  customs and driving tests. the union says it is concerned about pensions  sick pay and forced relocation as well as the cut in jobs. last month it was announced that a total of 37 social security offices and jobcentres across the uk would close in the first wave of plans to shed civil service jobs. the number of civil servants in britain rose to more than 520 000 in april. other areas the strike will affect include passports  museums and galleries  libraries and health and safety inspections.,0.92445374

755,business,us to rule on yukos refuge call yukos has said a us bankruptcy court will decide whether to block russia s impending auction of its main production arm on thursday.  the russian oil firm has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us in an attempt to halt the forced sale. however  judge letitia clark said the hearing would continue on thursday when arguments in the case would be heard. russian authorities are due to auction off yuganskneftegas on 19 december to pay a huge tax bill sent to yukos.  russian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm s most lucrative asset yuganskneftegas to help pay a $27bn (£14bn) back tax bill  which they claim is owed by yukos.  filing for bankruptcy protection in the us was  a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders  employees and customers   said yukos chief executive steven theede. the company added it had opted to take action through american courts as us bankruptcy law gives worldwide jurisdiction over a debtor company s property and because it was seeking a judiciary willing to protect the value of shareholders  investments. however  as the firm is based in russia and has no significant us assets  lawyers are unsure of the outcome of the case.  we are here to stop 60% of our body from being cut off on sunday   zack clement  a lawyer for yukos  told judge clark in an emergency hearing in houston  texas  on wednesday. as well as the bid to get chapter 11 bankruptcy - which protects firms from creditors  allowing them to continue trading as they restructure their finances - the group also made a claim for damages against the russian government. yukos asked the houston court to order russia to arbitration so that it can press claims for billions of dollars in damages over a  campaign of illegal  discriminatory and disproportionate  tax claims. mr clement said that under russian law  the russian government was obliged to enter into arbitration as set out in international law.  he added that the opening bid for the firm s yuganskneftgas unit was $8bn - less than half of the $20bn that yukos advisers say it is worth.  we believe the only significant bidder at the auction on sunday is gazprom   he said  referring to russia s natural gas giant. yukos maintains that the forced auction is illegal and  will cause the company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm.  many commentators believe the russian government s aggressive pursuit of yukos is a politically-motivated response to the political ambitions of its former chief executive  mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky  who had funded liberal opposition groups  was arrested in october last year on fraud and tax evasion charges and is still in jail analysts believe that if its production unit is auctioned off  it is likely to be bought up by a government-backed firm  like gazprom  effectively bringing a large chunk of russia s lucrative oil and gas industry back under state control.,1.0473313

1351,entertainment,ethnic producers  face barriers  minority ethnic led (mel) production companies face barriers in succeeding in the film and television industries  research has suggested.  the study  commissioned by pact and the uk film council  included interviews with industry experts and individuals. they indicated that career progression and a lack of role models are among the main problems within such companies. the research indicated that about 10% of independent production companies in the uk are minority ethnic led.  a minority ethnic led company is defined as one in which the majority of decision-making power rests with an individual or individuals from a minority ethnic group. the report also explored the problems faced by such companies when attempting to compete within the film and tv industries. it said they are often smaller than other companies and lack the resources  so are often squeezed out of the market by bigger firms. the research recommended that minority ethnic led companies could benefit from such positive actions as career training and business advice  plus improved communication within the film and tv sectors.  the uk has a rich and diverse culture and it is essential that it is reflected on film and television   said arts minister estelle morris of the findings.  i welcome this report which i hope will lead to more doors being opened and all businesses in our film and television industries being given the same opportunities.,-1.6829557
964,tech,gta sequel is criminally good the grand theft auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years  but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand tradition.  the 18 certificate gta: san andreas for the playstation 2 could have got away with merely revisiting a best-selling formula with a more-of-the-same approach. instead  it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps  carefree  over all the driv3r and true crime-shaped opposition. even in the year that will see sequels to halo and half-life  it is hard to envisage anything topping this barnstorming instant classic.  the basic gameplay remains familiar. you control a character  on this occasion a youth named cj  who sets out on a series of self-contained missions within a massive 3d environment. cj can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push-bike to a city bus to a plane. all come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in a tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family. to make things worse  he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town  and blackmailed by crooked cops played by samuel l jackson and chris penn. the setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional us state of san andreas  comprising three major cities: los santos  which is a thinly-disguised los angeles  san fierro  aka san francisco and las venturas  a carbon copy of las vegas. san andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range  cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing.  its ability to capture the ambience of the real-world versions of these cities is something to behold  assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since vice city. the streets  and vast swathes of countryside  are by turns gloriously menacing  grungy and preppy. flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail  the game s overall look  particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets  is stupendous. the outstanding bread-and-butter gameplay mechanics provide a solid grounding for the elaborate plot to hang on. cars handle more convincingly than ever  a superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds  and there s more traffic to navigate than before. park your vehicle across the lanes of a freeway  and within seconds there will be a huge pile-up. pedestrians are also out in force  and are a loquacious bunch. cj can interact with them using a simple system on the control pad. they will pass comments on his appearance and credibility  aspects that the player now has control over. clothes  tattoos and haircuts can all be purchased  and funding these habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in mini-games like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool. the character will put on or lose weight according to how long he spends on foot or in the gym. he will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up  but will swell up as a result of over-eating. and at last  this is a gta hero who can swim.  at a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young  san andreas  violence  or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence  are sure to inflame the pro-censorship brigade. developers rockstar have not shied away from brutality  and in some respects ramp it up from past outings.  when hijacking a car  for example  cj will gratuitously shove the driver s head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle. indeed  the tone is darker than the jokey vice city. the grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy 80s setting of the last game. this title  incidentally  is set in 1992  but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists. the wit is still present  just more restrained than in previous outings. a further reason for this is that the incredible range of in-vehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options  where gta games  trademark humour is anchored. the quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply off-the-chart. the game s rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed. it is a testament to san andreas  magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws  but plus-points are so numerous that the niggles don t detract. the on-screen map  for instance  is needlessly fiddly  an unwelcome change from past editions. there is also a very jarring slowdown at action-packed moments. and the game suffers from the age-old problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre  setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission. but the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive. you simply will not be bothered by these minor failings. san andreas is among the few unmissable games of 2004.,-1.2376122
928,politics,mallon wades into ne vote battle middlesbrough mayor ray mallon has been drafted in to boost the yes campaign as the north east assembly referendum enters its final week.  the former police chief  dubbed robocop for his zero tolerance style  clashed on thursday with sunderland no campaigner neil herron. mr mallon said an assembly would give local people more of a say over key issues such as transport and crime. but mr herron said north east people did not want or need an assembly.  the pair met on the platform at sunderland station as mr mallon toured the region highlighting claimed improvements to transport if the area gets an assembly. but mr herron - who gained fame as one of sunderland s  metric martyrs  and is running his own no campaign alongside the official north east says no campaign - said he was not convinced by mr mallon s arguments.  the reality is that it is not going to deliver   he said.  labour has had two-and-a-half years to convince people of this. if you can t sell a deal in that time  it is a bad deal.  on wednesday  mr mallon provoked fury by branding the official no campaign  two-bit tories  in a confrontation outside its durham headquarters.  the campaign is being run by two-bit conservatives who are not interested in what happens in the north east; they are interested in hitting the labour party over the head   he said. mr mallon is a late recruit to the yes campaign after rejecting overtures from no campaigners including  he claims  tory leader michael howard.  most local observers believe the contest is too close to call  although little recent polling has been carried out. yes campaign chairman john tomaney said he hoped for a late flurry of votes to boost turnout - something he says will boost their cause. he added:  the government exerts a lot of political power in the north east. the accountability should be in the north east as well.  he also defended the decision to attack the official no campaign s alleged political allegiances.  we felt we had to show what people were behind the no campaign - london tory spin doctors.  graham robb  spokesman for north east says no  said the yes campaign s decision to get personal dragged the campaign  into the gutter  and showed they were  rattled . and he hit back at mr mallon s claim that an assembly would improve transport links in the region.  it can push paper around but it can not get people moving   he said. some 487 939 people had returned their ballot papers by wednesday - a turnout of 25.7%. the deadline for voting is next thursday  4 november.,1.5075059

1057,business,yukos loses us bankruptcy battle a judge has dismissed an attempt by russian oil giant yukos to gain bankruptcy protection in the us.  yukos filed for chapter 11 protection in houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its yugansk division by the russian authorities. the court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of yugansk  which yukos claims was illegally sold. separately  former yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky began testimony on friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion.  mr khodorkovsky - who has been in jail for more than a year - pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities.  i pride myself on heading for 15 years a number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees   he told a russian court.  yugansk was auctioned to help pay off $27.5bn (£14.5bn) in unpaid taxes. it was bought for $9.4bn by a previously-unknown group  which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state-controlled oil company rosneft.  texas judge letitia clark said yukos did not have enough of a us presence to establish us jurisdiction.  the vast majority of the business and financial activities of yukos continue to occur in russia   judge clark said in her ruling.  such activities require the continued participation of the russian government.  yukos had argued that a us court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its yugansk unit was sold  since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer bruce misamore lives in houston. yukos claimed it sought help in the us because other forums - russian courts and the european court of human rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection. russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the us courts.  in her ruling  the judge acknowledged that  it appears likely that agencies of the russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under united states law . but she said her role was simply to decide on jurisdiction. the us court s jurisdiction had been challenged by deutsche bank and gazpromneft  a former unit of russian gas monopoly gazprom which is due to merge with rosneft. analysts said the ability of gazprom and rosneft to trade freely overseas had been stifled while the ownership of yugansk remained unclear.  yukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling. however  it claimed that the court had backed its argument in four out of five key issues.  we believe the merits of our case are strong and simple   said chief executive steven theede.  our assets were illegally seized. we want them back or damages paid.,1.384249
642,business,borussia dortmund near bust german football club and former european champion borussia dortmund has warned it will go bankrupt if rescue talks with creditors fail.  the company s shares tumbled after it said it has  entered a life-threatening profitability and financial situation . borussia dortmund has posted record losses and missed rent payments on its westfallen stadium. chief executive gerd niebaum stepped down last week and creditors are now pushing for greater control. shares in borussia dortmund  germany s only stock-market listed football club  dropped by almost 23% to 2.05 euros during early afternoon trading.  fund manager florian hamm - borussia dortmund s largest investor - said he would only invest more money in the company if he got a greater say in how it is run.  i demand better transparency   he is quoted as saying by germany s manger magazin. the club has also faced calls to appoint executives from outside the club.  borussia dortmund posted a record loss of 68m euros ($89m; £47m) in the 12 months through june. it made a loss of 27.2m euros in the first half of the current fiscal year and said that total debts will increase to 134.7m euros by the middle of 2006 unless a restructuring plan is pushed through.  this is the bill for their mismanagement over the past years   said hvb analyst peter-thilo halser. the club appointed an auditor  who has recommended a number of steps  including deferring the rent due on the stadium and suspending debt repayments until at least the 2006-2007 fiscal year. stephen schechter  a uk investment banker who has held talks with borussia dortmund over a possible bond sale  said the club needs a capital injection of 35m euros.  they need strong people on the board who do not have a history with the club   he said.,-2.512321
1306,entertainment,us  afflicted  with awards fatigue the film world and media may be wild about the oscars but cinema-goers and the tv-viewing public are sick of watching award ceremonies  according to some la film critics.  bob strauss  from the la daily news  thinks there are just too many televised gatherings of stars showering praise on each other. he came up with a colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events  which roughly translates a  celebrity love-in . this echoed the views of oscars host and comedian chris rock  who whipped up a media storm for saying he rarely watched them  calling award shows  idiotic .  as chris rock accurately said  they re about celebrity and fashion   mr strauss said. the recent grammy music awards proved to be a ratings loser  and it seems oscars organisers are determined not to go the same way.  recently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner.  unsurprisingly  this prompted press speculation that the changes were aimed at boosting flagging advertising revenue. but entertainment weekly s dave karger maintained the oscars only generated excitement outside the industry when a blockbuster  such as titanic or lord of the rings  was nominated. the near constant flow of us film awards  representing directors  actors and producers  guilds  also means  few surprises  are left by the time the oscar ceremony is upon us  he said. a quick scan of the los angeles times and los angeles daily news bears this out - speculation about who will win seems to have ground to a halt.  on thursday  the times simply printed a picture of the plastic tents going up outside the kodak theatre to protect the red carpet from rain. variety and the hollywood reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industry-related news  while in the uk bets have closed on the best actor category  with ray star jamie foxx a dead cert to win.  screen international s us editor mike goodridge thinks 2004 s films have simply not grabbed the public s imagination.  film-makers haven t produced films that people adore this year   he said.  they adored saving private ryan for example - people loved it and it made a ton of money.  2004 s films could be a reaction to 9/11 - there was a realisation in america that things might not be so rosy after all.  audiences don t necessarily want to see darker films such as million dollar baby  aviator and finding neverland  which end with casualty.  as to whether rock could pep up the awards  the critics were not hopeful.  mr strauss doubted whether rock would make an impact  but added:  i m all for lower ratings though - there are far more important things going on than the oscars.  mr karger said the comic might boost younger viewers  but mike goodridge thought rock s humour could prompt america s conservative states to switch off. so despite all this  did the critics have any views on who would win    clint eastwood s million dollar baby affected people emotionally  which is why it will beat aviator  which was about technical artistry not feelings   mr karger said.  eastwood has it in the bag   added mr strauss.  oscar voters often vote with their hearts not their heads.  and mr goodridge said best film and director were between martin scorsese s aviator and million dollar baby. mr karger  whose favourite film of the year was mike leigh s abortion drama vera drake  stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments.  i hope this is the year for small films to triumph   he said.  after all  it s still one of the biggest tv events of the year.,-0.95258856
1456,business,french wine gets 70m euro top-up the french government is to hand its struggling wine industry 70m euros ($91m) in aid to help it battle falling sales and damaging overproduction.  the financial package is aimed at assisting vintners in financial trouble and improving how its wine is marketed. the french wine industry  the world s second largest  has been hit by declining consumption at home and the growing popularity of new world wines. wine makers  however  claimed the support did not go far enough. the package was announced by agriculture minister dominique bussereau after talks with vintners  representatives.  the bulk of the money - about 40m euros - will be offered in the form of preferential loans to heavily indebted producers to enable them to reschedule their payments. a further 15m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives  which make up the majority of french producers  in low interest loans. efforts to promote french wine abroad are to be boosted by an extra 3.5m euros in funding. france fell behind the  new world  producers of australia  chile and the united states for the first time in 2003 in terms of exports.  domestic consumption  accounting for 70% of sales  has suffered from strict restrictions on advertising and tough drink-driving laws.  the aid package would  create a positive climate around french viticulture   mr bussereau said. however  wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for.  i am afraid the resources are not up to the ambitions   jean-michel lemetayer  from the fnsea agricultural union  told the associated press news agency. in an effort to tackle overcapacity  the government will agree that vines can be destroyed in areas where growers give their unanimous consent  while 500 vintners will be helped to take early retirement. the government will also seek european union approval to distil about 250 million litres of excess wine into alcohol  with vintners receiving compensation. production is currently outstripping demand by about 30%. the support is designed to make french producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across the wine industry. wine makers in france s best-known regions  such as burgundy  have found it hard to invest in new technology and to create recognisable brands to appeal to overseas buyers.,-2.0383391
1243,sport,bridge could miss rest of season chelsea left-back wayne bridge could miss the rest of the season with a suspected broken ankle.  the england international  24  was hurt in an innocuous challenge with alan shearer during the londoners  fa cup defeat at newcastle on sunday.  we think it s a big injury   said jose mourinho  whose chelsea team this week meet barcelona in the champions league and liverpool in the carling cup final. william gallas and damien duff could also miss the barcelona game. france defender gallas and ireland winger duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of chelsea s 1-0 defeat at st james  park.  with bridge having gone off after mourinho used all three substitutes  those knocks plus carlo cudicini s red card meant chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players. cudicini would not have played against barcelona  but had been promised a game in the carling cup final  although he will now miss the cardiff showpiece through suspension. the manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to barcelona  even though he has few options to replace bridge at left-back.  celestine babayaro left the club in january  ironically to join newcastle  and although gallas has deputised at left-back before  he is struggling to be fit himself. it could be that paulo ferreira  usually a right-back  is switched to left-back with glen johnson  who ended the newcastle game in goal  playing on the right. youngsters ben hudell  joe keenan and sam tillen would be options should mourinho decide to call up a replacement  but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a champions league tie. bridge s injury also means mourinho  who reportedly wants to sign ashley cole from arsenal  will not have a specialist  senior left-back for the run-in to the season.   he (bridge) has no chance of playing against barcelona  probably will not play against liverpool (in the carling cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season   he said.  the medical department will try to do everything to recover gallas and duff. we will have to wait and see  but i won t cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on tuesday.  shearer said he was unsure what caused bridge s injury.  i don t know what happened.  he said.  it was just a shame. i don t think we even touched each other.  by all accounts it s pretty serious. i went into the dressing-room after the game and wished him all the best.  mourinho  whose team are chasing three trophies  has already lost winger arjen robben to a serious injury.,1.3305485
1251,business,china bans new tobacco factories the world s biggest tobacco consumer  china  has said it will not allow any new tobacco factories to be built.  china already has more than enough cigarette-making capacity  according to a spokesman for the tobacco industry regulator quoted in china daily. the ban threatens to reignite tensions between the regulator and british american tobacco  which plans to become china s first foreign cigarette maker. a spokeswoman for bat declined to comment on the report.   china won t allow any new tobacco factories to be built  including joint ventures   said xing wangli  a spokesman for the state tobacco administration monopoly quoted in china daily. he also said that the state would retain its monopoly on cigarette distribution. china has 350 million smokers who consumer 1.7 trillion cigarettes a year. smoking is fashionable in china  where it is seen as an essential - and manly - sociable touch for some jobs  such as salesmen. more young  urban woman are taking up smoking too. in july 2004  bat announced it had won approval for to build a $1.5bn (£800m) joint venture factory in china which would make it the first foreign cigarette maker to manufacture there.  the state tobacco monopoly administration said a week later that it had not approved the deal  leading to an embarrassing public row. bat told the bbc at that time that it had not negotiated with the stmc  and secured approval from  the highest levels of government . since then  the row has flared occasionally  most recently at a forum in november. bat consistently declines to comment.  xing s statement comes as especially bad news for british american tobacco   the china daily newspaper said of the latest development. the bat spokeswoman said:  there is nothing for us to add...since our announcement in july last year. the central government of china is the authority that approved our strategic investment.  the decision to ban further tobacco factories does not apply to deals made before 2005  according to the french news agency afp. the joint venture factory was expected to take till 2006 to build. the bat spokeswoman would not comment on its progress. however  if the stma continues to take a tough stance  expansion opportunities could be limited.  china s tobacco market is increasingly valuable as anti-smoking campaigners target public smoking in the west. china daily said the market was currently enjoying steady growth  making more than 210bn yuan ($25.4bn) in pre-tax profits last year  almost double the figure in 2000. the paper made no mention of health concerns. the stma is trying to restructure the domestic tobacco industry  closing some factories  though such moves can be unpopular with local governments.,-1.1843295

1549,tech,how to make a greener computer the hi-tech industry is starting to get more environmentally aware. bill thompson thinks it s about time.  my first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as i drove around cambridge. now you can t buy petrol with lead additives  and we re all better off as a result. chip giant intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too  reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways.  apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic  mercury  cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves  the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up  with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents. and work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient  since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops  mobiles and music players.  one of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle. if you have got a phone or a computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive. a well-designed electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost. this is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in europe since from august the new waste electronic and electrical equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling.  they will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit  something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears. it is  as they say  about time. we have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment  and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage. the car engine is a case in point: lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder  a phenomenon called  knocking   so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere. redesigning engines and making petrol slightly different was a lot more work  so it took decades before it was done. we re seeing the same thing in the technology industry and  as a result  there are billions of devices  from old mobile phones to antique handhelds  that will have to be recycled in years to come. if apple gets its way then a lot of people are going to be buying a new mac mini and throwing away their old pc  keeping the monitor and other peripherals.  even if apple does not get its way  four or five-year-old computers are not good enough to run modern programs and it s not unreasonable to replace them. but what do we do with the old ones   i ve just looked around my office and i find two monitors  an old 386 pc  two old handhelds  three ancient laptops  four antique mobile phones  a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a sun workstation that is no longer really much use. they are all old enough to be hazardous waste - the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead - but it s possible that some of the components could be useful. i could take them up the to the council recycling centre  but it s a 10-mile drive away across town  and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best. here in cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste  a box for glass  cans and paper that can be recycled  and a black bin for the rest. there are bottle banks and clothing banks scattered around town and in supermarket car parks. would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too  i d probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box - at least eventually.  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.,-1.0902376

1441,tech,mobile games come of age the bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing. a brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below. part two will follow on monday.  reviews of call of duty  splinter cell - pandora tomorrow  lord of the rings and pocket kingdom will follow on monday if you think of snake when some mentions  mobile games  then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time. even before nokia s n-gage game phone launched in late 2003  many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset.  and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market. that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home  game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can. life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed. now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than 200 different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste. there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders  lunar lander and bejewelled. there are also versions of titles  such as colin mcrae rally  that you typically find on pcs and consoles.  there are shoot-em-ups  adventure games  strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets. rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film  understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost £5. what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push. by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals. the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too. almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3d graphics.  the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. many titles  particularly racing games  let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a  ghost  or  shadow  to see if you can beat them. a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or  if you are sitting close to them  via bluetooth short-range radio technology. with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing.  too fast too furious (digital bridges)  as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games - because i m rubbish at them. no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. winning gives you cash for upgrades. graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play.  fatal force (macrospace)  a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth. graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. both background music and sounds effects work well. the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders. weapons include flamethrowers  rocket launchers  grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. with the right power-up you can go into a matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range. online the game has quite a following with clans  player rankings and even new downloadable maps.,-1.086421

60,business,telegraph newspapers axe 90 jobs the daily and sunday telegraph newspapers are axing 90 journalist jobs - 17% of their editorial staff.  the telegraph group says the cuts are needed to fund an £150m investment in new printing facilities. journalists at the firm met on friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. the cuts come against a background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising. the national union of journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on monday or face a strike ballot.  pearson s financial times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters.  the national union of journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike.  managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities   said jeremy dear  nuj general secretary. nuj official barry fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies.  they have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members   said mr fitzpatrick  who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. the two telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.  some broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines  which are hitting revenues. the telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both the independent and the times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size.  the guardian is hedging its bets  planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental europe. the telegraph group was bought by the barclay twins - frederick and david - last year  having previously been owned by lord conrad black s hollinger international. the brothers are currently mulling the sale of another of their businesses  retailer littlewoods.  telegraph executive murdoch maclennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months.   journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper  and maintaining the quality of the daily telegraph and the sunday telegraph for our readers is vital   he said.  however  action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital.  many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages  or in some cases  have colour on every page. they are hoping that by boosting colour it will make their publications more attractive to advertisers and readers alike. in recent months news corp s news international unit  which publishes the sun and the news of the world  the guardian media group  trinity mirror and the daily mail & general trust have all announced substantial investments in new printing plants.,-2.2372737

 best song in 25 years  you must be joking. its good if you like that sort of thing  but really!  listened to angels on radio 1 this morning when i was driving into work. had not heard it for a while. i love robs voice  the lyrics and tune. perfection!  as usual  the public have short memories when it comes to voting for  the greatest . there must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more. it s not exactly groundbreaking. presumably  the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low...  i m actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years!!  what about the specials - ghost town  the buzzcocks - ever fallen in love with someone... happy mondays - kinky afro  mcalmont & butler - yes  joy division - love will tear us apart... angels is middle-of-the-road rubbish.  angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap. it s musically and lyrically inept; and fantastically overrated  a bit like mr williams himself. this result isn t very surprising though  the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music!  best of the last 25 years  maybe. cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody  but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really. not much competition in the last 25 years after all.  it s alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years     there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it s a travesty.  rubbish! who voted it for it to be included in any list  i am a regular listener to radio 2 but i don t recall the invitation to vote for this bland  slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn t know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last 25 years. how depressing and just when we thought manufactured  pop  was on the way out - where on earth did this dreadful list appear from   while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won  in all seriousness  i think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty. then again  well done robbie  good show.  you ve got to be kidding.  angels is a great song  but not the best song of the last 25 years. only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits.  i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don t think its the best song from the past 25 years! right enough  it is better than some of the others in this catergory  for example  what was will young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn t that good! i m happy for robbie himself though!  best song in the last 25 years  what a joke! think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels. phil collins doesn t deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote  angels is an overrated song  that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it. soppy rubbish at best. hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon  and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards.  so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today  for me it s proof that music and democracy just don t mix. still  at least it wasn t will young...  oh it s all just a bit of fun. people take these awards too seriously! robbie has millions of loyal fans  while even non-fans know the words to angels. him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards. personally i wanted will young to win  but that was not really due to his musical talent!  i hate the song  all it brings back is memories of school discos and no-one to slow-dance with!  i agree about angels. i never get fed up hearing it. whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up  smile and sing along (very badly  that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out). the song makes me calm and serene and happy. well done robbie.  i think that although robbie williams is a good performer  that angels isn t really that good a song. it certainly isn t anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush.  angels is a fantastic song. all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers. it s a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups.  robbie did in no way deserve that mantle. whenever we have these awards it is always  artists  from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...we forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example. they weren t cool at the time  but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think.  yes angels is the best song since the past 25 years  because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning.  i ve always disliked angels intensely. i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre-teens  teens and middle aged women to accept low quality/ low aspirational music as  classic  songwriting. it s  orrible. it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who don t particularly like music all that much. folks without collections; folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music. angels adds nothing - it is merely an irritating distraction - a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer s afternoon picnic. what a dreadful result. if you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don t you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote. booo hisss  angels  best song  you are kidding  right  last five years i might be willing to accept  but 25  no way. did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to  say  1995  really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century.  no surprise about robbie williams considering the list. where on earth did the nominations list come from     compiled by an eleven year-old girl perhaps   i mean  will young  come on.  what a load of crap  best song in the last 25 years - i don t think so!! what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless  but robbie williams doesn t even come close.  what a joke. that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word  angels  where i thrash around  and scream  no no no no no  until someone tells me  the radio s off . why a half-baked cheesy ditty like angels  which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example  and by whom)  should be voted the best song of the past 25 years  is beyond me. if this is the song against which all others are judged  then musicians may as well give up.  why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country   the initial list was very weak anyway  but angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!! i think not  i didn t realize radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10!!  people have such short memories! a great song yes  but the best of the last 25 years  not a chance. i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.  the great british public at work again. it s a mediocre  sentimental and safe song. granted  it s not too bad  either. but can it stand up against anything by the smiths (in particular  how soon is now  ) or anything from the stone roses  first album  nope.  no  because i m not female and i m not 10!  ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song. but it is no way the best song of the past 25 years! the shortlist wasn t great but him winning it is a joke!  predictable and laughable.  the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years. the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed. whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie s repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years.  i am a huge robbie fan and love that song. but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today  unfortunately they were left out of the list.  have radio 2 listeners even heard of joy division  a band who  through two albums  have had a bigger impact on music  and continue to do so  over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever will.  no doubt about it. there s not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling. some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances  but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.  it should have been joy division.those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song. i sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now  the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds  the beatles and nick drake have done for music today.  yes!! i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people. there were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win! robbie was a deserved winner.  i am astounded that such a second-rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs! it s a terrible song  voted for by the masses who don t have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music.  the best song of the past 25 years  really  come on  this is surely a joke  no  i think i need a long lie down...  it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division. i suppose it s confirmed one thing - the british public are consistently dull :- &lt;(  no offence robbie  but pleeease! there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids. no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music  and a further nail in the coffin!  i think robbie deserves it  he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide. anybody who says he doesn t deserve it is jealous of his success. the only real challenger was queen but hey  another one bites the dust!!  obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it.  if this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in trouble. sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material  but this is not the best record.  a sad day for music  it s not the type of music i normally like  but even as a diehard rock fan  i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people. that s why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years. it s a good all-rounder. just like robbie.  best song in 25 years  since 1980  i m confused.  angels  isn t a bad song. it s a nice  catchy  formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes. but this is not great music. if anything it s regressive. bland even. i suppose it s just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become.  granted angels is a good song  however it really wasn t up against any other proper competition. the queen s song was lackluster  and apart from kate bush  the other choices were pathetic! also  why weren t the stones there  david bowie  etc  there are so many greater songs than angels...i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn t getting more awards so they had to make one up for him!  best song of the last 25 years  what a ridiculuous concept  and an even more ridiculous winner. sigh. on the upside  at least it wasn t bohemian rhapsody  for which we should all be thankful.  angels is without doubt a great song but i really don t think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies  goodlooks than the actual song!!! don t get me wrong  i m not disputing his looks  but there are more deserved winners.  it would have been a travesty had angels not won. without angels  robbie williams may well not be where he is now  and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists. it has to be seen performed live  with 125 000 people singing along to be fully appreciated. well done rob.  i find it hard to believe that  angels  is the best we have to show for the past 25 years! i m rapidly redifining  best  in my own head now to mean  most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning . what about britpop  blur  oasis  suede  pulp... not only making fantastic songs but also making changes  doing something different. why must  best  always come down to most commercially popular   i ve nothing against robbie  i actually like his music  but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year  the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales. the same goes with the scissor sisters  i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award  but the album comes no where near u2 s new record  neither are they in the same league. once again there have been some baffling discisions made  they are not for artisic reasons  but for profit.  no surprise really  it s voted for by the general public. since when did they have taste in music   personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard!  it absolutely deserved to win. it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.  it s an absolute joke  however most of the original 25 were very poor choices as well. all in all a pretty pointless exercise !  the song is overplayed and oversentimental. out of the rather poor five choices that were left  it should have gone to either joy division or queen. i suppose we should be thankful that it didn t end up in the hands of will young though.  although it has nostalgia value  there is no way it deserved to win. everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody  nothing compares 2 u  etc. much better songs and more timeless. give it to someone with real talent.  although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years. this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye. why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that s all it means!,-2.9842272
2087,tech,cyber criminals step up the pace so-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004  say security experts.  the number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm messagelabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. in 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. other statistics show that in 2004 73% of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus.  in its end-of-year report  messagelabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. in september 2003  messagelabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. but by september 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month. worryingly  said the firm  phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data.  older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake  but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened. other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards.  e-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity   said mark sunner  chief technology officer at messagelabs.  in just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online   he said. mr sunner said messagelabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation.  already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed  indicating a shift from the random  scattergun approach  to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses   he said. although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004  viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. one of the biggest outbreaks took place in january when the mydoom virus started circulating. to date the company has caught more than 60 million copies of the virus. also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation. in 2003 only 40% of messages were spam. but by the end of 2004  almost three-quarters of messages were junk.,-0.3774829

584,sport,fa decides not to punish mourinho the football association will take no action against chelsea boss jose mourinho following his sending-off in sunday s carling cup final.  mourinho  who was sent from the touchline for appearing to taunt liverpool fans  has been  reminded of his responsibilities to the game . but the fa confirmed:  there will be no further action taken in this matter.  mourinho claimed his  silence  gesture was aimed at the media  although they were on the other side of the ground. the former porto coach was forced to watch the climax of his side s 3-2 victory over liverpool on television after being ushered away from the touchline by fourth official phil crossley. his gesture came after chelsea s equaliser on 79 minutes courtesy of a steven gerrard own goal. mourinho still faces an fa investigation into his allegation that manchester united s players  cheated  during january s carling cup semi-final at stamford bridge.  and uefa could also launch disciplinary action following mourinho s failure to attend a compulsory post-match press conference after chelsea s champions league defeat at barcelona last week. in addition  some time this month  chelsea must also answer a charge of failing to control their players during the premiership win at blackburn in february. and a charge of failing to control their supporters following a carling cup meeting with west ham earlier this season is still to be heard. the premier league is also continuing investigations into allegations chelsea officials tapped up arsenal defender ashley cole in january.,1.0951805
65,tech,broadband in the uk growing fast high-speed net connections in the uk are proving more popular than ever.  bt reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. the 600 000 connections take the total number of people in the uk signing up for broadband from bt to almost 3.3 million. nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of europe.  according to figures gathered by industry watchdog  ofcom  the growth means that the uk has now surpassed germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. the uk total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people  compared to 6.7 in germany and 15.8 in the netherlands. the numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from bt or via the many companies that re-sell bt lines under their own name. part of the surge in people signing up was due to bt stretching the reach of adsl - the uk s most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km.  asymmetric digital subscriber line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. the standard speed is 512kbps  though faster connections are available.  this breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas   said paul reynolds  chief executive of bt wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. bt retail  which sells net services under its own name  also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers. this was a slight increase on the previous three months. despite the good news about growth in broadband  figures from telecommunications regulator ofcom show that bt faces increasing competition  and dwindling influence  in other sectors. local loop unbundling  (llu)  in which bt rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer s home or office  is growing steadily. cable & wireless and ntl have announced that they are investing millions to start offering llu services. by the end of september more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called carrier pre-section (cps) services  such as talktalk and one.tel  which route phone calls across non-bt networks from a local exchange. there are now more than 300 different firms offering cps services and the percentage of people using bt lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%.,-0.74233055

736,sport,o sullivan keeps his powder dry when you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential.  ireland coach eddie o sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run-up to this season s six nations championship. he decreed after the 2003 world cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year. that became a reality at the end of last summer with a 10-week period at the start of the this season. it may have annoyed his scottish  and in particularly welsh  cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the celtic league. we will say nothing of mike ruddock   poaching   eight of the dragons side that faced leinster on sunday. but  like o sullivan  he was well within his rights  particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it. the irfu has thrown their weight behind o sullivan  who must be glad that in the main  there is centrally-controlled contracts. bar keith gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg  everyone of o sullivan s squad is fit  fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season s campaign.  but i doubt whether o sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players. he is not that sort of person. however  he may look at the overworked and injury-hit england  wales and france squads whose players have been overworked  and then pat himself on the back for his foresight. but there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game. already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season. a first grand slam since karl mullen s led the team to a clean sweep in 1948. with england and france visiting lansdowne road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down  everything looks perfectly placed. but in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any irishman.  under the burden of great expectations  ireland have crumpled. take the triple crown-winning side of 1985 under mick doyle. they were expected to up the ante further for a grand slam  only the second in ireland s history. what happened in 1986  whitewashed. you see  ireland  in any sport  love to be downsized. then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary. it is the nature of the beast. but o sullivan s side are very capable of proving a salient point this season. after their first triple crown for 19 years  they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder. o sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players  and they have repaid him in spades ... and there is more to come. he has some old dogs in his squad  but he will come to this season s championship with a different box of tricks  and a new verve to succeed. ireland can indeed succeed  but just whisper it.,1.5071847
123,tech,screensaver tackles spam websites net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites  internet portal lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail. lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out. the net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool  spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data.   we ve never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do   said malte pollmann  spokesman for lycos europe.  in the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users   he said   but now we are going to go one step further.    we ve found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers.  by getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver  lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity. mr pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with. he said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web.  every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day   he said   about one mp3 file.  but  he said  if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day. lycos did not want to use e-mail to fight back  said mr pollmann.  that would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing   he said.  the sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e-mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer.  typically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e-mail and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day. the list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real-time blacklists generated by organisations such as spamcop. to limit the chance of mistakes being made  lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods. as these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs  the burden of high-bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive  said mr pollmann. sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests. early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to 85%. users do not have to be registered users of lycos to download and use the screensaver. while working  the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data. the screensaver is due to be launched across europe on 1 december and before now has only been trialled in sweden. despite the soft launch  mr pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20 000 times in the last four days.  there s a huge user demand to not only filter spam day-by-day but to do something more   he said  before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive.,0.6738615
1280,politics,lords wrong on detainees - straw jack straw has attacked the decision by britain s highest court that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws.  the foreign secretary said the right to life was the  most important liberty  and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism. law lords were  simply wrong  to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. new home secretary charles clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.  the house of lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government s anti-terror policy.  but mr straw denied it amounted to a  constitutional crisis . he said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court.  the law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary   he told bbc radio 4 s today programme. the foreign secretary insisted it was for parliament  and not judges  to decide how best britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. but liberal democrat peer lord carlile  the government s independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws  said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. he said the law lords  ruling was an  embarrassment  for the government and major changes were needed to the law.  the ruling came on charles clarke s first day as home secretary following david blunkett s resignation. in a statement to mps  mr clarke said:  i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year.   in the meantime  we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords.  the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office s powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us. any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. but those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. on thursday  lord bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions  in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status  by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects  but not britons. lord nicholls of birkenhead  in his ruling  said:  indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.  in a statement  detainee  a  in woodhill prison said:  i hope now that the government will act upon this decision  scrap this illegal  law  and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones.  the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. solicitor gareth pierce  who represents eight of the detainees  claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to  madness   saying two were being held in broadmoor hospital.,-0.00457716

1533,politics,uk rebate  unjustified  - chirac french president jacques chirac has called the uk s £3bn rebate from the european union  unjustified .  speaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the eu would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances. earlier foreign secretary jack straw said the uk was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by margaret thatcher in 1984. he said it remained justified because less eu farm money came to the uk.  mr chirac told reporters in brussels:  one can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the british cheque. it can no longer be justified. it was from the past.  but a uk government official responded:  even with the rebate  the uk pays two and a half times more than france contributes to the eu budget. without it we would pay 14 times as much as france.  there can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate.   the 25-member eu is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period 2007-2013  with the bloc s luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a june summit. earlier conservative graham brady said the rebate was a  crucial test  of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for britain. eu commission president jose manuel barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end. mr straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the uk wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.  the uk  france  germany  austria  the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at 1% of member states  combined national incomes - the european commission has urged an increase to 1.26%. mr straw has said the eu commission s proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. shadow europe minister mr brady said:  i believe it is essential that britain keeps the rebate and i think it s a crucial test of how firmly the british government is prepared to stand up for britain internationally in europe.   the uk is already one of the biggest net contributors to the eu .  the foreign secretary meanwhile said the  justice  of the rebate remained.  we have one of the lowest net receipts of any eu country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency.  that continues to be the case.   uk independence party leader roger knapman said the rebate was  set in stone  and there was no reason to negotiate about it.  it is extraordinary to do it at this time  just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the eu. if we lose our rebate as well  the british taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that i think everyone will go off the european project.  eu leaders are holding talks in brussels on how to re-energise the sluggish european economy. uk prime minister tony blair is meeting his eu counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the european constitution. the plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction. critics - including germany and france - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in eastern europe  undercutting large eu economies and undermining social protections. there are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern european countries who will head west  exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in germany.  mr straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate.  european countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods   he said.  what we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services.  britain s low unemployment meant there was less  neurosis  about people coming from eastern european countries.  in countries like germany and france  where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment  there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in   he said.,-1.6016841

1578,business,golden rule boost for chancellor chancellor gordon brown has been given a £2.1bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule  which allows him to borrow only for investment.  the extra leeway came after the office for national statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years. it comes just weeks ahead of the budget and an expected general election. shadow chancellor oliver letwin said:  at best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government.   a review by the ons found it had made a mistake by  double counting  some spending on roads since 1998/9. correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment  thus helping mr brown to meet his  golden rule  of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle. economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the budget.  the changes by the ons increase the current budget measure for the past five years by £2.1bn in total. mr letwin said:  this is a very murky area... there will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled.  the conservatives also said mr brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual £10.5bn  black hole  in the nation s coffers. but the treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions.  in january the independent institute for fiscal studies (ifs) said mr brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year s budget. it also said the government might narrowly miss its  golden rule  if the current economic cycle ended in 2005/06. after the ons announcement  economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about £400m.  none of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years   said jonathan loynes  chief uk economist at capital economics.  accordingly  it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course.,-2.1435003

2095,tech,souped-up wi-fi is on the horizon super high-speed wireless data networks could soon be in use in the uk.  the government s wireless watchdog is seeking help on the best way to regulate the technology behind such networks called ultra wideband (uwb). ofcom wants to ensure that the arrival of uwb-using devices does not cause problems for those that already use the same part of the radio spectrum. uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances. one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home. the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second. uwb could also be used to create so-called personal area networks that let a person s gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves. the technology works over a range up to 10 metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data. at the recent consumer electronics show in las vegas products with uwb chips built-in got their first public airing.  currently  use of uwb is only allowed in the uk under a strict licencing scheme.  we re seeking opinion from industry to find out whether or not we should allow uwb on a licence-exempt basis   said a spokesman for ofcom.  companies have until 24 march to respond. in april the ec is due to start its own consultation on europe-wide adoption of uwb. the cross-europe body for radio regulators  known as the european conference of postal and telecommunications administrations (cept)  is carrying out research for this harmonisation programme. early sight of the cept work has caused controversy as some think it over-emphasises uwb s potential to interfere with existing users. by contrast a preliminary ofcom report found that it would be quite straight-forward to deploy uwb without causing problems for those that already use it. the ofcom spokesman said it was considering imposing a  mask  or set of technical restrictions on uwb-using devices.  we would want these devices to have very strict controls on power levels so they can not transmit a long way or over a wide area   he said. despite the current restrictions the technology is already being used. cambridge-based ubisense has about 40 customers around the world using the short-range radio technology  said david theriault  standards and regulatory liaison for ubisense. he said that uwb was driving novel ways to interact with computers.  it s like having a 3d mouse all the time   he said. he said that european decisions on what to do with uwb allied with ieee decisions on the exact specifications for it would help drive adoption. prior to its adoption as a way for gadgets and computers to communicate  uwb was used as a sensing technology. it is used to spot such things as cracks under the surface of runways or to help firemen detect people through walls.,0.7401643

309,politics,iraq advice claim sparks new row the tories say ministers must respond in parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the iraq war was drawn up at number 10.  downing street has denied the claims  made in a new book about the attorney general lord goldsmith s advice. lord goldsmith also denied them  saying he was not  leaned on  in any way. but the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general.  the government has consistently refused to publish lord goldsmith s advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.  but a short statement about lord goldsmith s position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action. it said it was  plain  iraq continued to be in material breach of un resolution 1441. in his new book  lawless world  philippe sands  a qc and international law professor  suggests the parliamentary answer was written in downing street. according to mr sands  lord goldsmith had warned tony blair in a document on 7 march 2003 that the use of force against iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second un resolution sanctioning military action.  mr sands told newsnight the government had prepared a legal team to be able to defend its case  in case legal action was taken against the uk over the war. on 10 march  military chiefs reportedly asked for an unequivocal statement about the legality of the war to make sure troops could be defended in a court of law. the book  being serialised in the guardian newspaper  says on 13 march lord goldsmith met then home office minister lord falconer and downing street adviser baroness morgan.  after that downing street proceeded to set out his [lord goldsmith s] view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on 17 march   said mr sands.  tory leader michael howard reiterated calls for the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general  warning:  this issue will not go away.   these revelations throw an intensive spotlight on to the cavalier way in which this government operates - even on an issue as important as peace and war.  the government needs to act to restore public confidence and trust.  liberal democrat foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell repeated his party s calls for lord goldsmith s first piece of legal advice to be made public.  the public interest  which the government claims justifies non-publication of the whole of the advice  can only be served now by the fullest disclosure.   in a statement to newsnight  lord goldsmith said:  in my parliamentary answer on march 17 2003  i explained my genuinely held independent view  that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions.  it was certainly not a view that i expressed as a result of being leaned on in any way  nor as i have already made clear  was it written by or at number 10.  the prime minister s official spokesman also rejected the claims  saying:  the attorney general made it clear the words and the judgement were his.  but ex-foreign secretary robin cook says all the advice should now be published. he said the claims suggested parliament had only received a pr&#233;cis of lord goldsmith s second opinion - and that it was actually drafted in no 10. this would be wrong even if lord goldsmith had signed the statement  mr cook said  because the attorney general s advice should be an  independent legal opinion   not subject to  political negotiation of this kind .,1.6938825
94,politics,amnesty chief laments war failure the lack of public outrage about the war on terror is a powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups  amnesty international s chief has said.  in a lecture at the london school of economics  irene khan said human rights had been flouted in the name of security since 11 september  2001. she said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message. and it had to fight poverty  not just focus on political rights for elites.  ms khan highlighted detentions without trial  including those at the us camp at guantanamo bay in cuba  and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems.  what s a new challenge is the way in which this age-old debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war   she said.  by using the language of war  human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war.  ms khan said such breaches were infectious and were now seen in almost very major country in the world.  the human rights movement faces a crisis of faith in the value of human rights   she said. that was accompanied by a crisis of governance  where the united nations system did not seem able to hold countries to account.  the amnesty secretary-general said a growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism.  public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups   she said. ms khan said the movement had failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights system. there needed to be a drive to use simpler language  talking about the basic morality of the issues rather than the complexity of legal processes. such efforts could make the issues more relevant to people across the world  she said.  the human rights groups also had to recognise there were new groups which had to be tackled in new ways as power dripped away from state governments. al-qaeda  for example  was not going to be impressed by a traditional amnesty letter writing campaign. more also needed to be done to develop a human rights framework for international business corporations. amnesty international members voted in 2001 to extend the organisation s work from political and civil rights to cover social and economic rights too. ms khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife.  we would be an elitist bunch working for the elites  for those who cannot read the newspaper of their choice rather than those who cannot read   she said. despite her concerns  ms khan dubbed herself a  hope-monger   saying she was confident the passions of the human rights movement could overcome the new challenges.,0.43317842
779,business,cuba winds back economic clock fidel castro s decision to ban all cash transactions in us dollars in cuba has once more turned the spotlight on cuba s ailing economy.  all conversions between the us dollar and cuba s  convertible  peso will from 8 november be subject to a 10% tax. cuban citizens  who receive money from overseas  and foreign visitors  who change dollars in cuba  will be affected. critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards  reflecting the cuban president s desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise. in a live television broadcast announcing the measure  president castro s chief aide said it was necessary because of the united states  increasing  economic aggression .  the ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the us government to suffocate our country   he said.  the bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on cuba in recent months. president bush s government  which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade embargo on cuba  introduced even tighter restrictions on cuba in may.  cubans living in the us are now limited to one visit to cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives. a leading expert on the cuban economy says that castro s tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture.  i think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash   says jose barrionuevo  head of strategy for latin american emerging markets for barclays capital.  it underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue.   the tax will hit the families of cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home. this money  known as remittances  can amount to as much as $1bn a year. those remaining in cuba will have to pay the tax. their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax  such as euros  or increase their dollar payments to compensate. however  many of cuban s poorest citizens could be worse off as a result. the tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit cuba every year  particularly those americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there.  cuba s tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and  according to the un economic commission for latin america  is now worth $3bn to the country.  the tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for cuba s cash-strapped economy. cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food  fuel and medicine. much of cuba s basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. in recent weeks  cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island. cuba s economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid 1990s as the collapse of the soviet union forced it to embrace foreign capital  decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise. however  a decline in foreign tourism since 2002  periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy. it has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government s economic problems. the tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading  mr barrionuevo said.  the main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries  like venezuela  which have restrictions on capital   he says. mr barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity.  it is intended to be a permanent measure but i am not sure it can last too long.,-0.6140404

1942,business,yukos accused of lying to court russian oil firm yukos lied to a us court in an attempt to stop the russian government selling off its key production unit  the court has heard.  the unit  yugansk  was sold to pay off a $27.5bn (£14.5bn) back tax bill. yukos argued that since it had a us subsidiary and local bank accounts  the us court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of yugansk. but deutsche bank - itself a target of a yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case.  deutsche bank s evidence came on the first day of a two-day hearing in houston. its lawyer  hugh ray  told the court that yukos had claimed it had transferred $27m into two texas bank accounts opened by its new us subsidiary. by doing so  he said  the firm had intended to reinforce its us presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in us courts. but he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after yukos made its bankruptcy application on 14 december  and then backdated.  yukos chief financial officer bruce misamore  who had moved to the us in early december to set up yukos usa  acknowledged the point. he said the discrepancy was only in the paperwork  but that money had indeed been transferred on 14 december. even so  he told the court that only $480 000 had been in the accounts that day  with the rest arriving a day later.  deutsche bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by yukos. it had agreed to loan to an arm of russian state gas firm gazprom the money to bid for yuganskneftegaz  as the yukos unit is formally known. the sale went ahead  despite an order from the us bankruptcy court ordered that it should be stopped. in the end  the auction was won by an unknown shell company for $9.4bn - much less than most assessments of its value - before ending up in the hands of state-controlled oil firm rosneft. rosneft  meanwhile  has agreed to merge with gazprom  bringing a large chunk of russia s very profitable oil business back under state control.  yukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the us because it feared it would not be able to do so in russia. it also said that in the event of going bust  it could offer the chance of restructuring.  it gives us a kind of life after death alternative   said yukos chief executive steven theede. yukos is currently suing four companies - gazprom  its unit gazpromneft  rosneft and the shell company which won the bidding - for their part in yugansk s disposal. it has also threatened to sue the russian government for $28bn. analysts have questioned whether a us court has any jurisdiction over russian companies  while moscow officials have dismissed yukos  legal wrangling as meaningless. yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky  once russia s richest man  is in prison  having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.,-0.74960566

2149,tech,wi-fi web reaches farmers in peru a network of community computer centres  linked by wireless technology  is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in peru.  the pilot scheme in the huaral valley  80 kilometres north of the capital lima  aims to offer the 6 000-strong community up-to-date information on agricultural market prices and trends. the agricultural information project for farmers of the chancay-huaral valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation  enabling them to coordinate their actions. more than 13 000 rural inhabitants  as well as 18 000 students in the region  will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure.  the 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. the network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in september.  the non-government organisation  cepes (peruvian centre for social studies) led the $200 000 project  also backed by local institutions  the education and agriculture ministries  and european development organisations.  the plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system   said carlos saldarriaga  technical coordinator at cepes. farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land. the board of irrigation users which runs the computer centres  aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years  through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes.  one of the key elements of the project is the agricultural information system  with its flagship huaral.org website. there  farmers can find the prices for local produce  as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. the system also helps the inhabitants of the chancay-huaral valley to organise their vital irrigation systems.  water is the main element that unites them all. it is a precious element in peru s coastal areas  because it is so scarce  and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it   mr saldarriaga told the bbc news website. the information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region  and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of peru and even around the world.  cepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the project s success.  throughout the last three years  the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them   said mr saldarriaga. the community training sessions  attended by an equal number of men and women  have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm.  we have had an excellent response  mainly from young people. but we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women  who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives.  so far  the huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive  and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers  organisations in peru.  this is a pilot project  and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places   underlined mr saldarriaga.  the cepes researcher recalls what happened in cuyo  a 50-family community with no electricity  during the construction of the local telecentre site. there it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate 2kw worth of power for the computers  the communications equipment and the cabin lights.  it was already dark when the technicians realised they didn t have any light bulbs to test the generator  so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs   recalls carlos saldarriaga.  the logical answer was  we don t sell any   so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing.  now  with the wireless network  cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.,-3.078433
1133,business,economy  stronger than forecast  the uk economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported  according to bank of england deputy governor rachel lomax.  private sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates  ms lomax said. other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in uk house price growth  she pointed out. this means that despite a strong economic growth  base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. official data comes from the office for national statistics (ons). though reliable  ons data takes longer to publish  so now the boe is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions.  recent work by the bank has shown that private sector surveys add value  even when preliminary ons estimates are available   ms lomax said in a speech to the north wales business club.  the ons is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on friday.  the mpc judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate   ms lomax said. the bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. rachel lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published  but substantially revised upwards years later.   the statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past   she said. improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the monetary policy committee (mpc) makes the right decisions  she said. the bank of england is working in tandem with the ons to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. her remarks follow criticism from the house of lords economic affairs committee  which said the mpc had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.  a slowdown in the housing market and this year s surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky  leading to a more uncertain outlook.  this year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s   ms lomax said.  the mpc will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.  decisions on interest rates are made after the mpc gathers together the range of indicators available every month. the clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction  ms lomax intimated.  in economic assessment  there is safety in numbers.,0.44915724
956,tech,web radio takes spanish rap global spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanish-language music. but what you will not find is much spanish-language hip-hop.  hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanish-speaking world  but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. but now  a us company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. los caballeros de plan g are one of mexico s hottest hip-hop acts. they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey. but most mexican hip-hop fans  not to mention fans in most of the spanish-speaking world  rarely get a chance to hear the group s tracks on the radio.   you can t really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in spanish... it s just not accessible   says manuel millan  a native of san diego  california.  it s really hard for the spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.  millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally.  mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music  and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. so  millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. the name says it all: it is web-based radio  devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. the site  which is in both in english and spanish  is meant to be easy to navigate. all the user has to do is download a media player. there are no djs. it is just music streamed over the net for free. suddenly  with the help of the website  los caballeros de plan g are producing  export quality  rap.  the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip-hop right now. the genre is in what millan calls its  infant stage . but the production values are improving  and artists such as argentina s mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better. mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com.  he s considered the eminem of argentina  and the latin american hip-hop scene   millan says.  he really hasn t had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world  but he s definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish-speaking world.  currently  the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com s top 10  as is cuban artist papo record.  every country s got it s own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs   millan says. latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world. right now  mexico leads the way  accounting for about 50% of listeners. but web surfers in spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station s traffic comes from there. that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanish-language rap and hip-hop. millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. that might be changing  though  as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences.  but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com s top 10. his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in spain. on his track uno contra veinte emcees  or one against 20 emcees  tote king shows he is well aware of that fact.  it s basically him bragging that he s one of the best emcees in spain right now   millan says.  and it s pretty much true. he has the tightest productions  and his rap flow is impeccable  it s amazing.  latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hip-hop and rap.  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.,-3.7489595
1368,politics,no uk apology  for colonial past the days of britain having to apologise for its colonial past are over  gordon brown has said.  the chancellor  speaking during a week-long tour of africa  said it was time to talk about enduring british values of liberty and tolerance. mr brown has signed a debt relief deal with tanzania which could cost the uk £1 billion. south african president thabo mbeki has attacked british imperialists  saying they treated africans like savages. mr brown said that missionairies had come to africa because of their sense of duty. he added that the history of internationalism and enterprise had given britain a greater global reach than any other country. bbc political correspondent mark mardell said britishness had long been a theme of the chancellor s but  never before has he been so outspoken in defending britain s past history .  the uk has pledged to pay 10% of the developing world s foreign debt bill in an attempt to fight poverty. on top of the relief deal with tanzania mr brown said the uk would make similar offers to 70 poorer nations around the world. under the plan - which could cost the uk £1bn - countries must spend the cash saved on health  education and welfare.  we make this offer unilaterally but we are now asking other countries to join us   the chancellor said. mr brown  on a week-long tour of africa  spent two days in tanzania before heading on friday evening to mozambique  a country where more than half of the 17-million population lives below the poverty line.  there he is expected to strike a similar debt relief pact. the chancellor said he hoped other g8 and european countries would follow suit. the uk has already cancelled its bilateral debts - money the uk alone is owed - with the world s poorest nations including tanzania. former international development secretary clare short questioned the effectiveness of debt relief as a means of tackling poverty.,2.0322835
647,politics,straw backs ending china embargo uk foreign secretary jack straw has defended plans to end the european union s arms embargo on china  despite opposition from the us and japan.  mr straw  visiting beijing  noted arms embargoes applied to china  burma and zimbabwe but not to north korea  which he said had a terrible rights record. the eu imposed its arms ban on china in 1989 after troops opened fire on protestors in tiananmen square. mr straw also signed a deal on china-uk tourism. it is expected this would increase the number of chinese tourists by 40 000 per year  providing $120m in revenue. china has in the past said it sees the weapons ban as politically driven  and does not want it lifted in order to buy more weapons. mr straw  speaking at a joint news conference with chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing  stressed this point.  the result of any decision [to lift the arms embargo] should not be an increase in arms exports from european union member states to china  either in quantitative or qualitative terms   mr straw said. earlier this week he said he expected the embargo to be lifted within six months.  but mr straw faces tough opposition to the move. tory foreign affairs spokesman michael ancram said lifting the arms embargo would be  irresponsible  and would damage britain s relations with the us. he said mr straw was  naive beyond belief  if he accepted china s claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons. the french want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to china; the chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from europe.  when he was in tokyo earlier this week  japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura told the british minister that his plan to remove the embargo was   a worrying issue that concerns the security and environment of not only japan  but also east asia overall . washington argues that if the embargo is lifted  it could lead to a buying spree for arms that china could use to threaten its diplomatic rival taiwan. beijing says taiwan is part of chinese territory and wants to unite it with the mainland  by force if necessary. the us is bound by law to help taiwan defend itself. washington has also voiced concern that the human rights conditions in china have not improved enough to merit an end to the embargo. it is an issue raised by human rights groups too. brad adams  from the uk s human rights watch  said:  this is a huge political signal from europe that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square.  but mr straw insisted the eu s code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.,1.7138581

1271,business,germany nears 1990 jobless level german unemployment rose for the 11th consecutive month in december - making the year s average jobless total the highest since reunification.  the seasonally adjusted jobless total rose a higher than expected 17 000 to 4.483 million  the bundesbank said. allowing for changes in calculating statistics  the average number of people out of work was the highest since 1990 - or a rate of 10.8%. bad weather and a sluggish economy were blamed for the rise. the increase  was due primarily to the onstart of winter   labour office chief frank-juergen weise said.  unadjusted  the figures showed unemployment rose 206 900 to 4.64 million - with many sectors such as construction laying off workers amid bad weather.  the three years of stagnation in the german economy came to an end in 2004. but the upturn is still not strong enough  to boost the labour market  mr weise added. news of the rise came as government welfare reforms came into force  a move that is expected to see unemployment swell still further in coming months. under the hartz iv changes  the previous two tier system of benefits and support for the long term unemployed has been replaced with one flat-rate payout. in turn  that means more people will be classified as looking for work  driving official figures higher.   be prepared for a nasty figure for january 2005  about five million unemployed on a non-seasonally adjusted basis   warned hvb group economist andreas rees. but he did add that the numbers should  subside  throughout the year  to remain near 2004 s level of 4.4 million jobless.  i don t expect a strong and lasting turnaround until 2006   german economy minister wolfgang clement said. by 2010  however  the hartz iv reforms should help cut the average jobless rate to between 3% and 5%  he added. europe s biggest economy has been too weak to create work as it struggles to shake off three years of economic stagnation. in recent months companies such as adam opel - the german arm of us carmaker general motors - and retailer karstadtquelle have slashed jobs.,1.7064886

172,business,australia rates at four year high australia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the country s economy.  the reserve bank of australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%  their first upwards move in more than a year. however  shortly after the bank made its decision  new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter. the bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts.  the rate hike was the first since december 2003 and had been well-flagged in advance. however  opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the australian economy grew just 0.1% between october and december and 1.5% on an annual basis.  the figures  representing a decline from the 0.2% growth in gdp seen between july and september  were below market expectations. consumer spending remains strong  however  and the bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures.  over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited   said ian macfarlane  governor of the reserve bank.  at 2.6%  inflation remains within the bank s 2-3% target range. however  exports declined in the second half of 2004  fuelling a rise in the country s current account deficit - the difference in the value of imports compared to exports - to a record australian dollar 29.4bn. the australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low.  the economy has been strong and it is properly moderating but it doesn t look to me like it s slowing in any unreasonable way   said treasurer peter costello. stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy.  that 1.5% annual growth rate is the lowest we have seen since the post-election slump we saw back in 2000-1   said michael blythe  chief economist at the commonwealth bank of australia.  this suggests the economy really did slow very sharply in the second half of 2004.,-0.6457052
1337,tech,big war games battle it out the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice.  the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats  building on many of the original s elements. for its part  the long-running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue  adapting the console game rising sun. call of duty: finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war 2 battlefronts including russia and north africa. it is a traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character  in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you. on a near-identical note  medal of honor: pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action. its arenas are the war s pacific battles  including guadalcanal and pearl harbour. you play one character throughout  a raw and rather talkative us soldier.  both games rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along. when this works  it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story. when it does not  it is tedious.  a winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault  where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii. you are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes  then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman  before seizing the anti-aircraft guns. it is one of the finest set-pieces ever seen in a video game. this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre-determined path  forcibly witnessing a series of pre-set moments of action  is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic. the genius of something like half life 2 is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection. this pair of games do not really accomplish that  being more concerned with imparting a full-on atmospheric experience.  call of duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation. finest hour has a similar determination  framing everything in moody wartime music  archive footage and lots of reflective voice-overs.  letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the call of duty endeavour  even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat. the game s drawback could be said to be its format; tastes differ  but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc. the mouse control is a big reason why  along with the sharper graphics a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety. call of duty on pc was more detailed  plot-wise and graphically  and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready. targeting with the ps2 controller proved tricky  not helped by unconvincing collision-detection. you can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim  yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him. checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot  which happens regularly  you are set harshly far back  and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again. the game wants to be a challenge  and is  and many players will like it for that. it is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its pc parent  the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive.  both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour. and in pacific assault in particular  their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless.  but the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial  designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all. of the two games  pacific assault gets more things right  including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation. it engages you very well and also looks wonderful  making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious far cry  although we had to ramp up the settings on a high-spec machine to get the most out of them. finest hour is by no means bad  and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming. those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented. but they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent.,-4.015481

102,business,why few targets are better than many the economic targets set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in 2000 were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the world s leading economy by 2010.  but the lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige. for many economists and analysts they are about ensuring europe doesn t become a global economic laggard. they are also about ensuring europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of asia  india and china  as well as with the economic might of the united states. that s why there was a tone of urgency in the report  out on wednesday  by the former dutch prime minister wim kok. mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets  five years on from their inception. his conclusion was simple: too many of the targets will be seriously missed.  lisbon risks becoming a  synonym for missed objectives and failed promises   his report said.  the status quo is not an option.   at risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe has built  it said. the report comes at a time when europe s competitive position is waning. the eu s economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next. while there has been growth in overall employment rates in europe  productivity lags behind that of the us. but meeting the lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far. that has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years.  as mr kok s report noted:  the ink had scarcely dried on the [lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded.   the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suit.   the circumstances weren t conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by eu leaders in lisbon in 2000. neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development  money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming a so-called  knowledge-based economy .  the [lisbon] vision is a compelling one  but in order to do it society has to change   said paul hofheinz of the lisbon council  a brussels-based citizen action group.  what you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change. you find trade unions fighting change. but also the employers  associations.  even though they tell you they re in favour of change  many are actually pushing for less competition  more subsidy and less free market activity.   but part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in lisbon five years ago. targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the lisbon case  they covered too much  according to the wim report. economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion  and even safety at sea. the agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised.   lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing   the kok report said.  everybody is responsible and thus no one.  that s why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators  with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth. it also recommends that the european commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they re taking towards meeting the targets  effectively  naming  shaming and faming .  rhetoric and delivery don t necessarily go hand in hand   mr kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report.  we don t have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another.   on one point mr kok was very clear: the european union should not try to emulate the us economy. the european economic and social model needs to change  but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth. in that sense  the lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters. the kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth.  it s very ambitious   said john palmer  political director at the european policy centre  a brussels-based think-tank.  this is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do. it s going to require quite new and innovative policies.  but some analysts believe that the kok report doesn t come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the lisbon targets a reality. for example  it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce. but it doesn t say how companies should be convinced to do this. it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission  jose manuel barroso  to adopt mr kok s recommendations and press them on eu governments. mr barroso has said that the eu s competitiveness will be his top priority. he expects his five-year term in office to be judged on europe s success in meeting the lisbon agenda.,-0.23661995

1966,sport,kuznetsova  failed a drugs test  us open champion svetlana kuznetsova has tested positive for a banned drug  according to belgian authorities.  belgian sports minister claude eerdekens said that the russian world number five tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine on 19 december. kuznetsova was playing in an exhibition event in charleroi at the time. eerdekens said:  there is a problem. ephedrine was discovered. she remains innocent until proved guilty. she can ask for it to be tested again.  the situation remains unclear as the tournament was not commissioned by the world anti-doping agency (wada)  the international tennis federation (itf) or the women s tennis accosiation (wta). the test was carried out by regional belgian authorities and kuznetsova has not yet been able to have a b sample tested.  speaking at the australian open on monday  before eerdekens identified her  kuznetsova said:  i m not worried. i m not using anything to push myself.  i have not been notified of any positive test  and i think it is unfair that it s come out the way it did.  eerdekens said that confirmation of the findings was sent last friday to the player s address in spain  as well as to the belgian prosecutors  office and the belgian and russian tennis federations. he conceded kuznetsova might have taken a medicine which contained the banned substance.  we have simply stated a fact   he said.  it is for the federation concerned to impose the disciplinary measures after a procedure that respects the defence.   either the ephedrine was taken to improve her performance or it is because she took some medicine legitimately to cure an infection.  however  kuznetsova s naming was condemned by russian tennis chief shamil tarpishchev.  first of all  this belgian sports minister has broken every ethical rule in the book by naming a player without any proof of wrongdoing  without any basic evidence   tarpishchev said.  we all know the basic principle in doping cases. if there is a positive sample  then they should notify the international tennis federation (itf) as well as the national federation within three days   he said.  this is not the case here. as of today we have not received any statement from the doping officials  nor did the itf.  today i called the itf headquarters and they told me they know nothing about it.  if wada (the world anti-doping agency) was behind the testing  then we would also have known something by now.  otherwise  all these looks to me as pure fiction and fabrication of the facts.,1.1045022

1397,politics,parties warned over  grey vote  political parties cannot afford to take older uk voters for granted in the coming election  says age concern.  a survey for the charity suggests 69% of over-55s say they always vote in a general election compared with just 17% of 18 to 24 year olds. charity boss gordon lishman said if a  decisive blow  was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out. a total of 3 028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study. mr lishman urged the next government to boost state pension.  he also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to  support us all in an ageing society .  older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives   mr lishman said.  political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote.  in the survey carried out by icm research  14% of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections. among the over-65s  70% said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election  compared with 39% of people under 55. age concern says the over-55s are  united around  key areas of policy they want the government to focus on. for 57%  pensions and the nhs were key issues  while the economy was important for a third  and tax was a crucial area for 25%.  the report was welcomed by conservative shadow pensions secretary david willetts.  the pensioners  voice must certainly be heard in the next election as they have never fitted into blair s cool britannia   he said.  labour s continued refusal to admit the true extent of the pensions crisis will be one of the monumental failures of this government.  he pointed to tory plans to increase the basic state pension to reduce means testing  strengthen company pensions and encourage savings. a liberal democrat spokesman said the party took the issues raised in the report very seriously. he highlighted the party s promises to raise the basic state pension  provide free long-term care for the elderly and replace council tax  seen as a particular problem for pensioners on fixed incomes. labour has said it wants to use savings reforms to incapacity benefit to improve the basic state pension and has set up a review of the council tax system.,4.4144373
777,politics,eu fraud clampdown urged eu member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in eu funds on a consistent basis  the uk s public spending watchdog has said.  the national audit office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling  the eu still had no common definition of fraud. it also expressed concern that  for the 10th year  the european court of auditors had qualified the eu accounts. the nao urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud. it said member states needed to be more accountable on how money was spent. the report said:  member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the european anti-fraud office on a consistent basis.   as the court has now qualified its opinion on the community accounts for a decade  it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of eu revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of eu resources.  it said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in eu funds in the uk in 2003  worth £38.5m (52m euros)  up from 831 cases worth £35.7m in 2002. at the same time  reported fraud throughout the eu dropped from 10 276 cases worth £808m to 8 177 cases worth £644m. edward leigh  chairman of the commons public accounts committee  said britain had to set an example when it assumed the eu presidency.   any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the uk taxpayer  given that we are the second largest net contributor to the community   he said.  departments responsible for administering eu funds need to make sure that they re doing everything possible to weed out improper spending.  the government must take the opportunity afforded by the uk presidency of the eu to press the commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity  and raise overall standards of financial management.  a spokesman for the european anti-fraud office said the organisation agreed with the nao s assessment of fraud reporting.  the quality of reporting does differ from member state to member state  and there is room for improvement   spokesman jorg wojahn said. he added that there is generally good co-operation with member states and the anti-fraud office on specific cases of fraud  with the statistics studied by nao providing a  good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud .,-2.6993856
544,entertainment,bening makes awards breakthrough film actress annette bening is up for an oscar for her starring role in the award-winning film being julia.  bening  who was born in texas in 1958  has gained prominence for a string of key roles. although an oscar has so far eluded her  her status as one of hollywood s favourite actresses remains solid. one of the biggest oscars buzzes in recent years was for bening s role as troubled carolyn burnham in 1999 s american beauty. but her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of hilary swank s leading role in boys don t cry. after opening her career in the theatre - and gaining a tony award nomination in 1986 - bening had a low-key spell in television. she then made her film debut as a sex-starved wife in 1988 s the great outdoors  opposite comics dan akroyd and john candy.  following a cameo in postcards from the edge  bening s breakthrough role came in 1990  playing seductive con artist myra langtry in the grifters - a role that won her an oscar nomination. despite some rave reviews  bening did not win the best supporting actress academy award.  however the high-profile performance enabled bening to capture roles in a number of big budget hollywood productions  co-starring with some of hollywood s greatest players  including robert de niro and harrison ford. but it was her role opposite warren beatty in 1991 gangster flick bugsy which had the greatest impact. bening played virginia hill  another role which won her high critical acclaim  but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 oscar nominations.  bugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for bening - she married beatty  with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in europe. the couple now have four children together. a pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered bening s career in the mid-1990s. she played michael douglas  opposite number in romantic comedy the american president  and as a  fiery  queen elizabeth i in a contemporary adaptation of shakespeare s richard iii.  bening was the first choice to play the female lead in american beauty  director sam mendes  film debut which was a critical and commercial success - but the actress had to be content with a bafta award for her strong performance. but current film being julia has made bening an award-winning actress rather than the perennial nominee  with success at the golden globes. the witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s london sees the eponymous theatrical diva - played by bening - grow tired of her success and fall for a young american - and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted academy award.,0.54556036

1282,business,uk firm faces venezuelan land row venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a british company as part of president chavez s agrarian reform programme.  officials in cojedes state said on friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the vestey group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers. the government is cracking down on so-called latifundios  or large rural estates  which it says are lying idle. the vestey group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure.  the firm  whose agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in venezuela  insisted that it had complied fully with venezuelan law. prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted hato el charcote  a beef cattle ranch owned by agroflora. according to reuters  they plan to seize 12 900 acres (5 200 hectares) from the 32 000 acre (13 000 hectare) farm.  officials claim that agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question. they also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production.  the legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus   state prosecutor alexis ortiz told reuters.  as a consequence the government has taken action.   controversial reforms passed in 2001 give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the 19th century.  critics say the powers - which president chavez argues are needed to help the country s poorest citizens and develop the venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights. the vestey group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities. but a spokesman added:  agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land.  the company pointed out that the farm  which employs 300 workers  provides meat solely for the venezuelan market.  last month  the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40 000. the authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had  nothing to fear . under president chavez  the venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state s involvement in the country s economy. it recently said all mining contracts involving foreign firms would be examined to ensure they provided sufficient economic benefits to the state.,0.41999912
744,business,wal-mart fights back at accusers two big us names have launched advertising campaigns to  set the record straight  about their products and corporate behaviour.  the world s biggest retailer wal-mart took out more than 100 full page adverts in national newspapers. the group is trying to see off criticism over it pay deals  benefits package and promotion strategy. meanwhile  drugs group eli lilly is planning a campaign against  false  claims about its product prozac. wal-mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the wall street journal  using an open letter from company president lee scott saying it was time for the public to hear the  unfiltered truth .   there are lots of  urban legends  going around these days about wal-mart  but facts are facts. wal-mart is good for consumers  good for communities and good for the us economy   mr scott said in a separate statement.  its adverts - and a new website - outlined the group s plans to create more than 10 000 us jobs in 2005. wal-mart s average pay is almost twice the national minimum wage of $5.15 (£3.90) an hour  while employees are offered health and life insurance  company stock and a retirement plan  the adverts say. unions accuse wal-mart of paying staff less than its rivals do  with fewer benefits. in california  the company is fighting opposition to new stores amid allegations it forces local competitors out of business. lawmakers in the state are also examining allegations that the firm burdens the state with an unfair proportion of employee health care costs.  i think they are going to have a tough time suddenly overcoming the perceptions of some people   said larry bevington  chairman of save our community - a group fighting to prevent wal-mart opening a store in rosemead  california. wal-mart is also fighting two lawsuits - one accusing it of discriminating against women and another alleging it discriminates against black employees.  meanwhile eli lilly is launching a series of adverts in a dozen major newspapers  to present what is says are the true facts about its anti-depressant drug prozac.  the move is in response to a british medical journal article that claimed  missing  lilly documents linked prozac to suicide and violent behaviour. in the averts  entitled an open letter from chief executive sidney taurel  the company says the article continues to  needlessly spread fear among patients who take prozac .  it was simply wrong to suggest that information on prozac was missing  or that important research data on the benefits and possible side effects of the drug were not available to doctors and regulators   the letter added. eli lilly s chief medical officer alan breier said that the article was  false and misleading  as the documents it referred to were actually created by officials at the us food and drug administration (fda) and presented to an fda meeting in 1991. later  fda medical advisors agreed the claims were based on faulty data and there was no increased risk of suicide.,0.043966293

1321,business,us retail sales surge in december us retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in december  boosted by strong car sales.  seasonally adjusted sales rose 1.2% in the month  compared to 0.1% a month earlier  boosted by a surge in shopping just before and after christmas. sales climbed 8% for the year  the best performance since an 8.5% rise in 1999  the commerce department added. the gains were led by a 4.3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out of showrooms. dealers were forced to cut prices in december to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started.  the increase in sales during december pushed total spending for the month to $349.4bn (£265.9bn). sales for the year also broke through the $4 trillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4.06 trillion however  if automotives are excluded from december s data  retail sales rose just 0.3% on the month. home furnishings and furniture stores also performed well  rising 2.2%. but as well as hitting the shops  more us consumers were going online or using mail order for their purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1.9%. however  analysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the federal reserve bank off its current policy of measured interest rate rises.  consumers for now remain willing to spend freely  sustaining the us expansion. given that attitude  the fed remains likely to continue boosting the fed funds rate at upcoming meetings   ubs economist maury harris told reuters.  retail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the us. consumer spending has been picking up in recent years after slumping during 2001 and 2002 as the country battled to recover from its first recession of the decade and the world trade centre attacks. during that time  sales grew a lacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later. looking ahead  analysts now expect improvement in jobs growth to feed through to the high street with consumer spending remaining strong. the belief comes despite the latest labor department report showing a surprise rise in unemployment. the number of americans filing initial jobless claims jumped to 367 000  the highest rate since september. however  long-term claims slipped to their lowest level since 2001.,-0.45283365

271,tech,apple unveils low-cost  mac mini  apple has unveiled a new  low-cost macintosh computer for the masses  billed as the mac mini.  chief executive steve jobs showed off the new machine at his annual macworld speech  in san francisco. the $499 macintosh  sold for £339 in the uk  was described by jobs as the  most important mac  made by apple. mr jobs also unveiled the ipod shuffle  a new music player using cheaper flash memory rather than hard drives  which are used in more expensive ipods.  the new computer shifts the company into new territory - traditionally  the firm is known as a design and innovation-led firm rather than as a mass-market manufacturer. the mac mini comes without a monitor  keyboard and mouse  and a second version with a larger hard drive will also be sold for $599.  the machine - which will be available from 22 january - was described by jobs as  byodkm... bring your own display  keyboard  and mouse . in an attempt to win over windows pc customers  mr jobs said it would appeal to people thinking of changing operating systems.  people who are thinking of switching will have no more excuses   he said.  it s the newest and most affordable mac ever.  the new computer has been the subject of speculation for several weeks and while few people will be surprised by the announcement many analysts had already said it was a sensible move. in january  apple sued a website after it published what it said were specifications for the new computer. ian harris  deputy editor of uk magazine mac format  said the machine would appeal to pc-owning consumers who had purchased an ipod.   they want a further taste of mac because they like what they have seen with ipod.  harris added:  everybody thought that apple was happy to remain a niche maker of luxury computers  and moving into a market dominated by low margin manufacturers like dell is a bold move.  but it shows that apple is keen to capitalise on the mass market success it s had with the ipod. the mac mini will appeal to pc users looking for an attractive   no fuss  computer.  the new ipod shuffle comes in two versions - one offering 512mb of storage for $99 (£69 in the uk) and a second with one gigabyte of storage for $149 (£99) - and went on sale tuesday. the music player has no display and will play songs either consecutively or shuffled. the smaller ipod will hold about 120 songs  said mr jobs. mr jobs told the delegates at macworld that ipod already had a 65% market share of all digital music players.,3.9543107
167,politics,top judge clashes with ministers the uk s top judge has revealed he has clashed with ministers about how the heads of public inquiries are chosen.  lord woolf said he was determined his current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry should continue as a guard for judicial independence. but he told mps the lord chancellor  lord falconer  was insisting he should have the final say in such cases. lord hutton s inquiry into the death of dr david kelly sparked debate about who should run inquiries.  the government says the lord chancellor would be unlikely to go against lord woolf s wishes. lord woolf  who is lord chief justice of england and wales  was giving evidence to the commons public administration select committee s inquiry into public inquiries. he said he had not been involved in the choice of lord hutton  who as a law lord did not come under his jurisdiction. but he argued he should have a veto on whether judges generally should chair a particular inquiry and if so  which judge it should be. in written evidence to the committee  lord woolf said:  i have  so far  failed to reach an agreement with the lord chancellor on this issue ... i intend to maintain my position and will press for this safeguard to be in any future legislation.   judges should think carefully before heading an inquiry into a highly political issue  such as the intelligence on iraq s weapons of mass destruction  he said. he argued:  the subject matter of the inquiry may be so political that it would be damaging to the judiciary for a judge to be involved.  in addition  the question of whether there should be an inquiry at all may be highly controversial and if a judge is appointed  the judiciary  as a result of the appointment  may be seen as siding inappropriately with the government.  he told the mps:  anything that tends to undermine the confidence of the public in the judiciary worries me.   lord woolf said the current rules were not written down but it was inconceivable in practice that the lord chancellor would overrule his concerns. but that situation could change with new legal reforms. the issue had been  overlooked  when a new agreement was drawn up about those responsibilities and the dispute had emerged in later discussions.  what i am asking for is a situation where if the lord chancellor cannot obtain my agreement [on appointing a judge]  it doesn t happen   he said.  lord woolf said he did not think there would be difficulties but he wanted to establish the principle. a department for constitutional affairs spokeswoman said lord woolf and lord falconer agreed about what happened in practice.  their disagreement is about whether the legislation should include a requirement for consultation or concurrence - a very narrow dispute  in lord woolf s words   she said.  as lord woolf also acknowledged  it is highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would appoint a judge against the wishes of the lord chief justice.  judges are free to decide for themselves whether to accept positions as inquiry chairs.  parliament will examine the issue next year when it debates a new bill about public inquiries.,0.061271667

326,business,consumers drive french economy france s economic growth accelerated in the last three months of 2004  driven by consumer spending  a report shows.  gross domestic product (gdp) rose by 0.8% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three month period  the statistical office insee said. that expansion pushed annual growth to 2.3%  the fastest rate in two years. consumer spending was up by 1.2% in the fourth quarter  and there also was a rebound in business investment that gave the recovery an extra shove.  analysts warned that france still was facing challenges and was unlikely to keep expanding at its current pace.   france still has a strong economic growth   said marc toutai  an economist at natexis banques populaires.  but  if we check the figures in detail  there s a problem.   consumer spending is still high. but french households have spent their savings to consume.  france can t sustain a high growth rate without an improvement in the job market. there s too much of a gap between growth and employment.  unemployment levels are currently stuck at about 10%  and is proving difficult to bring down despite government efforts. another worry is that demand in germany and italy  two of france s main trading partners  is sluggish.  despite the concerns  analysts pointed out that france was outperforming the majority of its european counterparts and that its economy was looking more robust than in previous years. as well as strong domestic demand  exports climbed by 1.3% in the fourth quarter - the biggest increase in foreign sales for a year.  it s an economic growth that seems well balanced   said nicolas claquin  an analyst at ccf.  in the beginning of 2004  growth was mainly driven by consumer spending. here it gets contributions from investment and exports  though household consumption is still strong.  but we expect overall economic growth to fall to 2.0 percent in 2005.,1.5355248
1772,sport,athens memories soar above lows well  it s goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens.  obviously  there s no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe. but i want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember - or forget - for athletics.      one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly s success in the 800m.  winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. kelly had been full of  should i  shouldn t i   thoughts about going for the double in athens. i thought why wouldn t you do the 800m  it s your best event  it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story.      the victory for the british men s 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games. i think the four of them - jason gardener  darren campbell  marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis - knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake.      hicham el guerrouj s olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly s on a global scale.  he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5 000m titles. as soon as he had added the 5 000m crown and i had finished commentating  i jumped up  ran down the stairs  pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories. hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with  even though my french and his english are not very good.      what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood. dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10 000m five days later was not wise. that was her heart and not her head reacting. paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.  things like niggling injuries  not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained. and if even the smallest thing doesn t feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon  10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. the positive thing to take from paula s olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people - including me.      purely as a race  paula s victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. it was so nip-and-tuck between her and kenya s susan chepkemei and you don t usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because  to use one of my favourite words  paula showed real  bouncebackability . and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out.      kelly and the 4x100m boys  victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team. we should be concerned that we re not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level.  the only individual men s finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m. i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed  and that s where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy. dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb. the thing is if we don t have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn t look good for the beijing olympics and beyond.      i tell you what i really enjoyed this year  benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march. in the absence of paula  we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve. so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special.      to be honest  i m getting bored with all the drug scandals  especially balco. i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on.  having said that  i m always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou  well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while. the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it.,0.80065775

240,business,retail sales show festive fervour uk retail sales were better than expected in november as christmas shoppers began their seasonal flock to the high street  figures show.  the office for national statistics (ons) said retail sales rose 0.6% on the month and 6.1% on the year. but the figures  along with this week s inflation report  could trigger another interest rate rise in the new year. however  recent data from the british retail consortium showed a 0.2% slip in high street sales during november.  the ons data confounded analyst expectations. many had expected sales to fall slightly in november as shoppers put off buying christmas presents until december. however  retailers  attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind november s unexpected rise in sales  they say. aggressive tactics  such as one-day discount sales adopted by stores such as marks & spencer  appear to have paid off.  price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales hasn t grown as much as volumes   said investec economist david page. the figures sparked a rally for sterling as the data supported the view that it is too early to assume that base rates have peaked.,-0.057137012
1185,tech,rich pickings for hi-tech thieves viruses  trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change.  the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash  steal valuable data or take over home pcs. viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code.  the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines. but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package.   you cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to   said pete simpson  head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift. now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms  or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments.  it s about outright criminality now   said mr simpson  explaining why this change has come about. he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. former virus writer marek strihavka  aka benny from the 29a virus writing group  recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers  phishing gangs  and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. not least  said paul king  principal security consultant at cisco  because the defences against such attacks are so common.  in many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now   he said. few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written  many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data.  if you think of criminals they do not do clever   said mr king   they just do what works.   as the tactics used by malicious programs change  said mr king  so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network.  many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. as well as using different tactics  criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent.  the main motivation now is money   said gary stowell  spokesman for st bernard software. mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. with almost any phishing or spyware attack  criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover. so-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends  to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.,-2.4024248

1286,politics,protesters plan airport challenge campaigners against the expansion of britain s airports have begun challenging the government s plans in the high court.  baa s expansion of stansted airport in essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. opponents say the £2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from heathrow and gatwick was used. they said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. baa are also owners of the airports at heathrow and gatwick. they have said they cannot raise the money needed for the stansted upgrades from current landing charges. baa also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.  groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion  heathrow anti-noise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth. their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at luton airport  or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at heathrow. if the group wins  the government s future aviation plans outlined in last year s transport white paper could be left in ruins.  the campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports  such as one planned for the isle of sheppey east of london. lord hanningfield  leader of essex county council  told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  we are going to the high court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry.  we want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation  consultation and thought before the government came out with its green paper.  then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go.  he added:  politicians should not decide where runways should be.  the stansted expansion  apart from the building of the new runway  would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.  the airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the uk. but baa has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. at heathrow  gatwick  edinburgh and glasgow airports  baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september 2004  which will close next week. baa is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked  unblighted price. at heathrow  baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental  air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. at gatwick  the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.,-1.5225749
1423,sport,robben and cole earn chelsea win cheslea salvaged a win against a battling portsmouth side just as it looked like the premiership leaders would have to settle for a point.  arjen robben curled in a late deflected left-footed shot from the right side of pompey s box to break the home side s brave resistance. chelsea had been continually frustrated but joe cole added a second with a 20-yard shot in injury-time. nigel quashie had pompey s best chance when his effort was tipped over. the fratton park crowd were in good voice as usual and  even though portsmouth more than held their own  chelsea still managed to carve out two early chances. striker didier drogba snapped in an angled shot to force home keeper shaka hislop into a smart save while an unmarked frank lampard had a strike blocked by arjan de zeeuw. but pompey chased  harried and unsettled a chelsea side as the south-coast side started to gain the upper hand and almost took the lead through quashie.  the midfielder struck a swerving long range shot which keeper petr cech tipped over at full stretch. pompey stretched arsenal to the limit recently and were providing a similarly tough obstacle to overcome for a chelsea team struggling to exert any pressure. velimir zajec s players stood firm as the visitors came out in lively fashion after the break but  just as they took a stranglehold of the match  the visitors launched a counter-attack. drogba spun to get a sight of goal and struck a fierce shot which rocked keeper hislop back as he blocked before arjan de zeeuw cleared the danger.  the home side were also left breathing a sigh of relief when a glen johnson header fell to gudjohnsen who had his back to goal in a crowded pompey goalmouth. the icelandic forward tried to acrobatically direct the ball into goal but put his effort over. but  just like against arsenal  portsmouth let in a late goal when robben s shot took a deflection off matthew taylor on its way past a wrong-footed hislop. and cole put a bit of gloss on a hard-fought win when he put a low shot into the bottom of the pompey net.  hislop  griffin  primus  de zeeuw  taylor  stone (cisse 76)  quashie (berkovic 83)  faye  o neil  kamara (fuller 65)  yakubu.  subs not used: berger  ashdown.  kamara.  cech  paulo ferreira  gallas  terry  johnson  duff  makelele  smertin (cole 73)  lampard  robben (geremi 81)  drogba (gudjohnsen 58).  subs not used: cudicini  bridge.  paulo ferreira  robben  lampard.  robben 79  cole 90.  20 210  a wiley (staffordshire).,2.134464
785,business,fresh hope after argentine crisis three years after argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis  there is fresh hope.  the country s economy is set to grow about 8% this year after seeing 9% growth last year  a sharp turnaround from 2002 when output fell 11%. the unemployment rate is improving  too: it is set to slip below 13% by the end of the year  down from 20% in may 2002. true  problems remain  but the overall picture is one of vast improvement. even the international monetary fund (imf) admits this.  the argentine authorities are proud  should be proud  of the strong performance of the economy   thomas dawson  an imf director  said earlier this month.  argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in 2001 culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors. the debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which  at least initially  was made worse by the government s decisions. pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the country s massive debts. in response  angry crowds of ordinary argentines took to the streets where dozens of lives were lost in clashes with the police. two presidents and at least three finance minister resigned in less than a month. argentina was on the brink of collapse. the fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the peso s decade-long peg to the us dollar in february 2002. the subsequent devaluation saw thousands of people s life savings disappear. scathes of companies went bust.  three years ago  every sector [of the economy] was hit by the crisis   said entrepreneur drayton valentine. it really was dire.  but since then  the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically  in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within brazil.  agriculture and tourism are helping   said entrepreneur drayton valentine.  mr valentine  who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina  was fortunate: at the time of the crisis  his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad. but now he is using his money to help with the start-up a trading company. he explained that initially  his firm is going to export building materials to spain and united states. then  he would like to diversify to other areas  depending on the market.  locally there is a sense of recovery  many companies are exporting now   he said  noting that a lot of firms  which were closed during the crisis  are re-opening.  but not all that shines is gold. argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of 2001. president nestor kirchner s administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors  but with the debts  nominal value standing at around $100bn it is not proving easy. debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate. argentina s current offer implies that the creditors would get just 25 cents for each dollar they are owed  according to the creditors. understandably  they want more and until they do  both they and others are loath to continue lending. for president kirchner  this proves a hopeless challenge. real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay  observed jack boorman  adviser to imf s managing director  rodrigo rato.  everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached   he said.  the cost is enormous  and continues to be paid  and will not be reversed by any restructuring.   with the international negotiations being troubled  it is of little help to president kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well.  this is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits.  the situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in argentina    said carlos baez silva  president of aara  an association that represents bank account and bond holders. few people have recovered more than about half their savings  mr baez silva estimated  pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government  people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe.  a lot of them invested in good faith   he said.  the argentine state responded by taking most of their investments.  the affair has made mr baez silva disillusioned with the country s legal system. on occasion  the supreme court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents  he says  insisting that the system cannot be trusted.  people have to deposit their money in the banks  not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses.  mr valentine  who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina  agreed.  if i have to save pesos [the local currency] there is not much problem  but i will think twice before i deposit dollars in a bank .,-0.24465227

1560,business,china had role in yukos split-up china lent russia $6bn (£3.2bn) to help the russian government renationalise the key yuganskneftegas unit of oil group yukos  it has been revealed.  the kremlin said on tuesday that the $6bn which russian state bank veb lent state-owned rosneft to help buy yugansk in turn came from chinese banks. the revelation came as the russian government said rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with china. the deal sees rosneft receive $6bn in credits from china s cnpc.  according to russian newspaper vedomosti  these credits would be used to pay off the loans rosneft received to finance the purchase of yugansk. reports said cnpc had been offered 20% of yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. analysts said one factor that might have influenced the chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from yukos  yugansk s former owner  if cnpc had become a shareholder. rosneft and veb declined to comment.  the two companies [rosneft and cnpc] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries   said russian oil official sergei oganesyan.  there is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.   the announcements help to explain how rosneft  a medium-sized  indebted  and relatively unknown firm  was able to finance its surprise purchase of yugansk. yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.  the embattled russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. but yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. once the country s richest man  mr khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.  the deal between rosneft and cnpc is seen as part of china s desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. china s thirst for products such as crude oil  copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels.  clearly the chinese are trying to get some leverage [in russia]   said dmitry lukashov  an analyst at brokerage aton.  they understand property rights in russia are not the most important rights  and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.   if the price of oil is fixed under the deal  which is unlikely  it could be very profitable for the chinese   mr lukashov continued.  and rosneft is in desperate need of cash  so it s a good deal for them too.,-0.49186897

223,politics,no-one can define new hunt ban  the new law banning hunting with dogs is  so poorly drafted  no-one can define the offence  pro-hunt mps say.  the accusation came after it emerged a devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to  chase away unwanted animals  from his farm. because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting. lib dem mp lembit opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting - chasing away - and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules.  north devon landowner giles bradshaw was put in touch with the middle way group  of which mr opik is a co-chairman  after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry  defra. he had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the hunting act. mr bradshaw was initially told it was an offence - prompting him to complain. the middle way group also said mr bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free. in a later conversation mr bradshaw was told that according to defra s lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was  not in fact hunting as described in the hunting act 2004 therefore you would not be committing an offence .  mr opik said:  hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the hunting act.  now defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting -  chasing away  which isn t even covered by the act.  however  all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals.  how is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting  exempt hunting  drag hunting  unintentional hunting  a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away   tory mp peter luff  another co-chairman of middle way  said that the legislation was  so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence .   it is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law. however  i seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating.  mike hobday  of the league against cruel sports  said:  there is no confusion  it is a matter of simple common sense.  if mr bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence.  if all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer  then nobody can define that as hunting.,0.7909851

2202,tech,local net tv takes off in austria an austrian village is testing technology that could represent the future of television.  the people of engerwitzdorf are filming  editing and producing their own regional news channel. the channel covers local politics  sports  events and anything that residents want to film and are prepared to upload for others to watch on pcs. the pilot has been so successful that telekom austria is now considering setting up other projects elsewhere.   it s growing unbelievably fast   said rudolf fischer  head of telekom austria s fixed line division. the trial of buntes fernsehen (multi-coloured tv) was started in late 2004 and creates a net-based tv station run by the 8 000 residents of engerwitzdorf. the hardware and software to turn video footage into edited programmes has been provided by telekom austria but this equipment  following training  has been turned over to the villagers. any video programme created by the villagers is uploaded to a buntes fernsehen portal that lets people browse and download what they want to watch. most people watch the tv on their home pc and a broadband connection is needed to get broadcast quality programmes. in the first four months of the project villagers have created 60 films and put together regular reports on local news items.  they have adopted it very quickly   said mr fischer.  they like the possibility to create their own content and see what s going on in the area.   it s kind of the democratisation of local tv   he said   because none of the bigger broadcasters would ever do anything like this for that region.  the buntes fernsehen project has been such a success that telekom austria is now considering setting up other schemes in similarly rural areas. mr fischer said it was taking the roll-out to other areas slowly because of the work involved in setting up the scheme  getting backers from local government and educating people how to make programmes. the engerwitzdorf scheme is an outgrowth of telekom austria s online tv channel aon which lets people watch programmes on their pc. aon streams a couple of live channels  plus sports  news and music programmes on to the net and has a pay-for-download section that lets people watch what they want when they want to watch it. in october a larger tv-on-demand project is due to launch in vienna that will let people download many programmes from the net.,-0.021989822
1275,business,could yukos be a blessing in disguise  other things being equal  the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business.  but in the looking-glass world of modern russia  the opposite might just be true  a new report* has argued. the study  from the centre for economic policy research  does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos. but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms  even targets of the tax police.  an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive  even accounting for increased levels of taxation   the authors say.  the paper s reasoning is complex  and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular  the propensity of management to steal from the company. the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal  since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. in the west  meanwhile  higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. on the other hand  increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent  forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. the net result  the authors say  is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.  after vladimir putin became president in 2000  he did not raise taxes  but put a lot of effort - too much  critics argue - into enforcement.  since then  the russian stock market has more than trebled in value  a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. the report highlights the case of sibneft  a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year. after mr putin came to power  the company s overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4%  and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. but shareholders benefited hugely: sibneft started to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. according to the authors  although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time  the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers.  does this analysis make sense  in part  certainly. for all its faults  corporate russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000. companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards. foreign direct investment  long negligible  is starting to flow in serious amounts - $7bn in 2003 - and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe. but the authors  model does not quite cover all the complexities. for a start  the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit  governments want to maximise tax revenue. in fact  the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. companies can  for example  persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes.  and the authors  definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western. genuine  disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced. the case against yukos  for example  has moved in fits and starts  with little clarity from the government about its intentions  and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. as far as most commentators are concerned  the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta  rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. since yukos  founder  mikhail khodorkovsky  was arrested a year ago  the russian market has dropped by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.,-2.5450854

1110,tech,what high-definition will do to dvds first it was the humble home video  then it was the dvd  and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition.  high-definition gives incredible  3d-like pictures and surround sound. the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so  and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out. but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds  it will profoundly change home entertainment. for rick dean  director of business development for digital content company thx  a high-definition future is an exciting prospect. he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy  finding nemo  the incredibles and indiana jones.  there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds   he told the bbc news website.   the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined.  the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master   he says. but currently  putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand.  as much as you compress the picture data rate wise  you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master   he explains.  i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very exciting.   high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to. it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months  time. mr dean is confident though:  i think if they see real hd [high-definition]  not some heavily compressed version of it  there is such a remarkable difference.  i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen.   high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too. on the whole  producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed. equally  it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd.  when we master movies right now  our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second   says mr dean.  our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second.  that s a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about 98%. so if you have anything that allows more space  you don t have to compress so hard.  studios could fit a lot more marketing material  games  and features  onto high-capacity dvds. currently  an entire dvd project can take up to three months  says mr dean. although the step of down-converting will be bypassed  this will realistically only save a day s work  says mr dean. one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems. on the fairly complex star wars disks  making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone. if studios want to cash in on the extra space  it could mean extra human hours  for which someone has to pay.  if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks  it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required.  and if studios do focus on delivering more  added value content   thinks mr dean  ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it. those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd. but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price  studios will listen  thinks mr dean.  high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike. more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous.  when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i  everybody was very sun-tanned  but that was make-up.  in the hd version of episode i  all these make-up lines showed up   explains mr dean. the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too.   there are scans of a corridor [on the death star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots  there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways.  you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn t see it.  what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur. with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas  this line blurs even further. it could also mean that how we get films  and in what format  will widen.  in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip [internet protocol - broadband]  giving a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive   says mr dean. but that is some time off for most  and for now  people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves.,-3.193921

1416,tech,web helps collect aid donations the web is helping aid agencies gather resources to help cope with the aftermath of the tsunami disaster.  many people are making donations via websites or going online to see how they can get involved with aid efforts. high-profile web portals such as google  yahoo  ebay and amazon are gathering links that lead people to aid and relief organisations. so many were visiting some aid-related sites that some webpages were struggling to cope with the traffic. an umbrella organisation called the disasters emergency committee (dec) has been set up by a coalition of 12 charities and has been taking many donations via its specially created website. it urged people to go online where possible to help because donations could be processed more quickly than cash donated in other ways  meaning aid could be delivered as quickly as possible. the site has so far received almost £8 million  with more than 11 000 donations being made online every hour.  telco bt stepped in to take over the secure payments on the dec site and provided extra logistical support for phone and online appeals after it was initially crippled with online donations. it has also provided space in london s bt tower for one of the call centres dealing with donations.  some of the web s biggest firms are also helping to channel help by modifying their homepages to include links to aid agencies and organisations collecting resources. on its famously sparse homepage google has placed a link that leads users to a list of sites where donations can be made. among the 17 organisations listed are oxfam  medecins sans frontieres (doctors without borders) and network for good. many of the sites that google lists are also taking online donations. online retailer amazon has put a large message on its start page that lets people donate money directly to the american red cross that will be used with relief efforts. auction site ebay is giving a list of sites that people can either donate directly to  divert a portion of their profits from anything they sell on ebay to the listed organisations or simply buy items that direct cash to those in the list. yahoo is proving links direct to charities for those that want to donate. the auction drop website is asking people to donate old digital cameras  computers and other gadgets they no longer want that can be auction to raise cash for the aid effort. sadly  the outpouring of goodwill has also encouraged some conmen to try to cash in. anti-fraud organisations are warning about e-mails that are starting to circulate which try to convince people to send money directly to them rather than make donations via aid agencies. those wanting to give cash were urged to use legitimate websites of charities and aid agencies.,-0.088309765
2178,entertainment,hollywood ready for oscars night hollywood is preparing for the biggest night in the film world s calendar  the 77th academy awards  on sunday.  a host of stars are expected to grace the red carpet outside los angeles  kodak theatre  including johnny depp  cate blanchett and leonardo dicaprio. british actors in attendance include nominees clive owen  imelda staunton  kate winslet and director mike leigh. the aviator leads the shortlist  but critics believe the night may belong to clint eastwood s million dollar baby. a recent poll of us pundits found eastwood s boxing drama had become the new favourite to win best film over the howard hughes biopic.  if the 74-year-old does win  he will become the oldest person ever to be named best director at the ceremony. uk critics still favour the aviator for best film  but believe the best director title will generate a close fought battle between eastwood and martin scorsese.  scorsese has never won the best director prize  despite four previous nominations for films including raging bull  goodfellas and gangs of new york. eastwood has won best director once before  for unforgiven in 1993. most experts predict the twice-nominated jamie foxx will win best actor for his portrayal of singer ray charles  while vera drake star imelda staunton looks likely to lose out in the best actress field to hilary swank in million dollar baby. the uk s highest hopes remain with clive owen  who has scooped both the golden globe and the bafta for his supporting role in closer. actor and comedian chris rock will host the event  which will be broadcast with a seven-second time delay to allow censors to cut out any unsuitable content.   we have the bleep machine ready  but bleeps will be used as needed   producer gil cates told reporters. however  he added that he strongly disapproved of the growing tendency to censor live broadcasts on us tv.  he also played down fears that rock  who is known for using strong language in his stand-up routines  might cause controversy on the night. the 40-year-old comic has already promised not to swear live on air during the show.  chris has a sense of humour and everything he says is really said humorously   cates said.  you need a movie star and someone who is a stand-up comic so they can deal with the vicissitudes of the show.  security will also be tight  with police employing a system to detect sarin nerve gas.  we are pulling out all the stops   said john miller  chief of counterterrorism at the los angeles police department. the show is  a symbol of american culture and has the potential to be a high-visibility target   he added. meanwhile  organisers have erected a canopy over the red carpet following an outbreak of torrential rain in los angeles over the past week. cates said the covers would be removed if the threat of wet weather receded. details have also emerged of the contents of this year s gift bags  which are given to nominees and presenters on the night. this year s bags will include a gift certificate for a luxury beach resort  a pair of mink eyelashes and a kitchen set with a year s supply of tea and coffee. the event will be televised by the abc network from 1700 local time (0100 gmt)  and on sky movies in the uk from 0130 gmt.,-1.2181077
2098,business,irish company hit by iraqi report shares in irish oil company petrel resources have lost more than 50% of their value on a report that the firm has failed to win a contract in iraq.  reuters news agency reported that iraq s oil ministry has awarded the first post-war oilfield contracts to a canadian and a turkish company. by 1700 gmt  petrel s shares fell from 97p ($1.87) to 44p ($0.85). petrel said that it has not received any information from iraqi authorities to confirm or deny the report.  iraq is seeking to award contracts for three projects  valued at $500m (£258.5m). turkey s everasia is reported by reuters to have won a contract to develop the khurmala dome field in the north of the country. a canadian company  named iog  is reported to have won the contract to run the himrin field. ironhorse oil and gas has denied to reuters that it is the company in question. these two projects aim to develop khurmala field to produce 100 000 barrels per day and raise the output of himrin. the winners of the contract are to build new flow lines and build gas separation stations. the contract to develop the suba-luhais field has not yet been awarded as iraq s oil ministry is studying the offers. if iraq s cabinet approves the oil ministry s choice of companies  then this will be the first deal that iraq has signed with a foreign oil company. iraq is still trying to boost its production capacity to match levels last seen in the eighties  before the war with iran. oil officials hope to double iraq s output by the end of the decade.,1.0976052
1076,entertainment,paraguay novel wins us book prize a novel set in 19th century paraguay has won the $10 000 (£5 390) fiction prize at the us national book awards.  lily tuck s the news from paraguay is a fictionalised tale about paraguayan leader francisco solano lopez and his irish mistress. but the annual awards  which were presented in new york on wednesday  were not without controversy. children s author judy blume  who was given an honourary medal  used the ceremony to speak out over censorship.  sales of blume s books have exceeded 75 million  but her work - which features frank narratives about families  religion and sexuality - is closely watched by the censors. blume said:  the urge to ban is contagious. it spreads like wildfire from community to community. please speak out. censors hate publicity.  her medal marks the second year in a row the honourary prize went to someone as notable for popular success as literary greatness. last year s honorary winner  stephen king  accused the industry during the 2003 ceremony of snobbery against popular writers. but his argument that the award should help sell books instead of honouring excellence is not shared by everyone.  this year s fiction panel overlooked high-profile works such as philip roth s the plot against america and instead chose five little-known books  all by new york-based women. one fiction judge  stewart o nan  carried around a note written on a napkin that said:  i would hope that our caring more for the quality of a work than its sales figures make us a friend of books  not an enemy.  the national book awards non-fiction prize was awarded to kevin boyle s for arc of justice  which focuses on a black family s fight to live in a white detroit neighbourhood in the 1920s. the award had created a lot of interest this year after the surprise inclusion of the of the 9-11 commission report looking into the events of the 11 september terrorist attacks on the us. pete hautman won the young people s literature prize for his novel godless. the winner in the poetry category was jean valentine for door in the mountain: new and collected poems  1965-2003.,-1.7073936
2162,tech,who do you think you are  the real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net  argues analyst bill thompson. it is what happens when it arrives at the other end.  the financial services authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data. the fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society - our identities. armed with the personal details that a bank holds  plus a fake letter or two  it is apparently easy to get a loan  open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else s name. and it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving. identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime  and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills  receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish.  but  however careful you may be  if the organisations you trust with your personal data  bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble. it is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a well-placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system. in fact  i suspect that the fsa is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time. has anyone checked bob cratchit s family links to the criminal underworld  i wonder  and it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted. health authorities  government agencies and of course the big e-commerce sites like amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters. the good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to. and as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements  banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details. fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office  plugging it into a usb slot and sucking down customer files.  companies like securewave  for example  can restrict the use of usb ports just to authorised devices or even to an individual s personal memory card. these solutions are not perfect  but it does not feel like a wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system. however the warning does highlight one of the major issues with e-commerce and online trading - the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the  back office . it has been clear for years that the real danger in paying for goods online with a credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked.  in fact i do not know of a single case where an e-mail containing payment details has led to card fraud.  there are simply too many e-mails passing over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud. cd universe  powergen and many other companies have left their databases open and suffered the consequences. and just last week the online bank cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name. whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job  the issue is the same: how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused  any organisation that processes personal data is  of course  bound by the data protection act and must take proper care of it. unauthorised disclosure is not allowed  but the penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the act so convoluted as to be worthless in practice. this is not something we can just leave it to the market. the consequences of having one s identity stolen are too serious  and markets respond too slowly. after all  i bank with cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that i did not even consider it when i heard about their security problems. i doubt many others have closed their accounts  especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future. the two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law  so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes  or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft. i have never felt comfortable with the us practice of suing everything that moves  partly because it seems to make lawyers richer than their clients  so i know which i d prefer.  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.,-1.0810595

470,politics,citizenship event for 18s touted citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday  charles clarke has said.  the idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches  inclusive citizenship  particularly for ethnic minorities. a pilot scheme based on ceremonies in australia will start in october. mr clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. britain s young black and asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nation s heritage as part of the government s new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their  other cultural identities  alongside being british. the launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in britain. on monday school inspection chief david bell  accused some islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to british society.  the muslim council of britain said ofsted boss mr bell s comments were  highly irresponsible . the home office started work on its community cohesion and race equality strategy last year and the outcome  launched on wednesday  is called  improving opportunity  strengthening society . it is aimed at tackling racism  exclusion  segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism.  it represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups   said a home office spokesman.  it is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.  the spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.   it is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems   the spokesman added. launching the initiative mr clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. he added:  but while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving  some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare  education or housing.  this strategy sets out the government s commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.  some 8% of the uk population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 census.  the downing street strategy unit in 2003 said people from indian and chinese backgrounds were doing well on average  often outperforming white people in education and earnings. but those of pakistani  bangladeshi and black caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites  it said. the home office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. the programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools.,1.0224075
1741,tech,us state acts to stop  spammers  us state texas has filed a lawsuit against two men believed to be among the world s top five spammers.  it is seeking millions of dollars in damages in a civil lawsuit filed earlier this week. the texas attorney general said it started the legal action as messages sent by the alleged spammers broke three laws governing e-mail marketing. the company named in the lawsuit denied any wrongdoing and said it complied with all relevant laws.  the texas lawsuit was filed against ryan samuel pitylak  a university oftexas student  and mark stephen trotter of california. both are thought to be the top executives in three companies - payperaction llc.  leadplex llc. and leadplex inc - that are suspected of sending out many millions of unwanted e-mail messages.  illegal spam must be stopped   said greg abbott  texas attorney general announcing the legal action.  spam is one of the most aggravating and pervasive problems facing consumers today.  the attorney general alleges that messages sent by mr pitylak and mr trotter s companies broke the 2003 controlling the assault of non-solicited pornography and marketing act (can-spam) as well as the texas electronic mail and solicitation act and texas deceptive trade practices act. all three acts confer cash penalties for each violation of their terms. if the men are found guilty and all penalties are applied  the two men could face a damages bill running into millions. mr abbott said the messages sent by the pair broke laws by using misleading subject lines  not identifying themselves as adverts and offering services for which they had no licence to do so in texas. lawyers for the alleged spammers said the lawsuit was groundless and the two men would defend themselves strongly against the accusations.  leadplex and payperaction are legitimate internet marketing companies that are in complete compliance with the federal can-spam act   said lin hughes  speaking on behalf of mr pitylak and mr trotter. in a similar move the us federal trade commission (ftc) has won a court order that stops an international group of spammers sending sexually explicit e-mail. the ftc took the action because the messages being sent violated several parts of the can-spam act. in particular  the pornographic messages did not identify themselves as being sexually explicit  had deceptive subject headings  did not have working opt-out mechanisms  failed to mention they were adverts and did not give the sender s real world address. the court order stops the spammers sending e-mail and freezes assets prior to a hearing on a permanent injunction.,0.03981638

1340,tech,open source leaders slam patents the war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents.  in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement. mitchell kapor  chairman of the mozilla foundation  warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future. linux is a freely-available alternative to microsoft s windows. it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles  which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees. the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made 500 of its patents freely available. other companies are expected to follow suit.  there are between 150 000 and 300 000 registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted. this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office.  some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they can t afford to take them to court   said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office. some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future.  if totally pushed to the wall - because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software...of course they re going to unleash the wmds   mr kapor is reported as saying. microsoft did not want to comment directly  referring the issue instead to trade body intellect  of which it is a member.  as far as intellect is concerned  open source and patents have co-existed for many years without problems   said spokeswoman jill sutherland.  the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software    we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents  copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries  and not be forced into using one or the other   she added.,-1.4986882

1360,business,call centre users  lose patience  customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up  a survey suggests.  once past the welcome message  callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music. the drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year.  customers are getting used to the idea of an  always available  society   says cara diemont of it firm dimension data  which commissioned the survey. however  call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls  she says  from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year. when automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation  where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages  the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. one possible reason for the lack in patience  ms diemont says  is the fact that more customers are calling  on the move  using their mobile phones.  the surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres  growing range of tasks.  once a call centre may have looked after mortgages  now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards  insurance and current accounts   ms diemont says. problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training  the survey found.  in what dimension data calls an  alarming development   the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days  leaving  agents not equipped to deal with customers . this  ms diemont warns  is  scary  and not good for the bottom line either. poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. as a result  call centres have a high  churn rate   with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year  which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer s query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%. when the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%  but that is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate.  suggestions that  outsourcing  - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like india or south africa - is to blame are wrong  ms diemont says.  there are  no big differences in wait time and call resolution  between call centres based in europe or north america and those in developing countries around the world.  you can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place   she says. however  companies that decide to  offshore  their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. only 42% of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. but not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres. they give three key reasons for not making the move:  - call centre operations are part of their business  core function     - they are worried about the risk of going abroad    - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive. the survey was conducted by sunovate on behalf of dimension data  and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents. what are your experiences with call centres  are you happy to listen to vivaldi or greensleeves  or do you want an immediate response  and if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job,-1.5700068

1640,tech,blog  picked as word of the year the term  blog  has been chosen as the top word of 2004 by a us dictionary publisher.  merriam-webster said  blog  headed the list of most looked-up terms on its site during the last twelve months. during 2004 blogs  or web logs  have become hugely popular and some have started to influence mainstream media. other words on the merriam-webster list were associated with major news events such as the us presidential election or natural disasters that hit the us.  merriam-webster defines a blog as:  a web site that contains an online personal journal with reflections  comments and often hyperlinks . its list of most looked-up words is drawn up every year and it discounts terms such as swear words  that everyone likes to look up  or those that always cause problems  such as  affect  and  effect .  merriam-webster said  blog  was the word that people have asked to be defined or explained most often over the last 12 months. the word will now appear in the 2005 version of merriam-webster s printed dictionary. however  the word is already included in some printed versions of the oxford english dictionary. a spokesman for the oxford university press said that the word was now being put into other dictionaries for children and learners  reflecting its mainstream use.  i think it was the word of last year rather than this year   he said.  now we re getting words that derive from it such as  blogosphere  and so on   he said.  but   he added   it s a pretty recent thing and in the way that this happens these days it s got established very quickly.   blogs come in many different forms. many act as news sites for particular groups or subjects  some are written from a particular political slant and others are simply lists of interesting sites. other terms in the top 10 were related to natural disasters that have struck the us  such as  hurricane  or were to do with the us election. words such as  incumbent    electoral  and  partisan  reflected the scale of interest in the vote. blogs also proved very useful to both sides in the us election battle because many pundits who maintain their own journals were able to air opinions that would never appear in more mainstream media. speculation that president bush was getting help during debates via a listening device was first aired on web logs. online journals also raised doubts about documents used by us television news organisation cbs in a story about president bush s war record. the immediacy of many blogs also helped some wield influence over topics that made it in to national press.  this is despite the fact that the number of people reading even the most influential blogs is tiny. statistics by web influence ranking firm hitwise reveal that the most popular political blog racks up only 0.0051% of all net visits per day. one of the reasons that blogs and regularly updated online journals have become popular is because the software used to put them together make it very easy for people to air their views online. according to blog analysis firm technorati the number of blogs in existence  the blogosphere  has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. technorati now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million. some speculate that less than a quarter of this number are regularly maintained. according to us research firm pew internet & american life a blog is created every 5.8 seconds. another trend this year has been the increasing numbers of weblogs that detail the daily lives of many ordinary workers in jobs that few people know much about. in many repressive regimes and developing nations  blogs have been embraced by millions of people keen to give their plight a voice.,-3.0155354

1003,tech,microsoft releases bumper patches microsoft has warned pc users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in windows programs.  in its monthly security bulletin  it flagged up eight  critical  security holes which could leave pcs open to attack if left unpatched. the number of holes considered  critical  is more than usual. they affect windows programs  including internet explorer (ie)  media player and instant messaging. four other important fixes were also released. these were considered to be less critical  however. if not updated  either automatically or manually  pc users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely  install programs  change  and delete or see data.  one of the critical patches microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some ie flaws. stephen toulouse  a microsoft security manager  said the flaws were known about  and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw  he did not rule them out. often  when a critical flaw is announced  spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. a further patch fixes a hole in media player  windows messenger and msn messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month. the most important ones are those which are classed as  critical . its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker sybari software as part of microsoft s plans to make its own security programs.,5.191425

1501,tech,broadband soars in 2004 if broadband were a jumbo jet  then 2003 would have seen it taxiing down the runway  firing up its engines and preparing for take-off. but this year has seen it soar.  in the spring it literally took to the skies as lufthansa and british airways trialled it on flights. this perhaps said more about how indispensable people were beginning to perceive the technology  rather than how useful sky-high broadband would actually be. it was flying high and by the autumn  five million britons had signed up for high-speed net access at home.  such enthusiasm is unlikely to dampen any time soon and experts predict that by the end of next year the numbers will have risen to more than eight million  or more than 30% of homes. the two key factors in whetting people s appetite were falling prices and a huge marketing push. when operators such as bt and telewest offered standard 512k broadband for less than £20 at the beginning of the year  it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached - broadband had truly gone mass market. a feeding frenzy followed as firms vied for eyeballs in a price war reminiscent of that following the mass market take-up of dial-up. broadband for less than £10 was even touted by some firms  although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business models.  for those who became broadbanders in 2004 there was no turning back and the days of waiting for the modem to kick in began to seem as outdated an idea as a jungle without celebrities. the rest of the world was also falling in love with the benefits of fast internet access  to the tune of 100 million connections worldwide by april  prompting research firm point topic to declare it one of the fastest growing technologies ever. by september  the number of broadband connections in the uk finally overtook dial-up and in december bt announced that it was making a new broadband connection every 10 seconds.  broadband was being mentioned on the 10 o clock news and in the tabloids; the sun even carried a cartoon joke about it. but two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlines. in may  bt quietly announced that it was shaving 70% off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges  so-called local loop unbundling. the vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes. at the moment bt has a stranglehold on more than 80% of these lines making it the key voice in deciding what adsl products get into homes. with cheaper local loop unbundling  rivals to bt can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise-like. it will mean the uk will finally catch up with countries such as france and the netherlands  where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to 15mb (megabits per second). and the major price fall means that  rather than just talk about it  companies are actually starting to get their own equipment into bt s exchanges. it may not seem that exciting but it is a remarkable transition given that just a few years ago the arguments over local loop unbundling bore more than a passing resemblance to the northern ireland peace talks - fraught  bitter and with no end in sight.  another big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of bt s reach  meaning more than 95% of the population could get broadband  regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived.  there was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to 1mbps broadband  they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadband-enabled exchange. for thousands frustrated by their inability to get the technology  the news meant they could finally join in. broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators ntl and telewest also had a bumper year. the biggest news for them was increased speeds  introducing 2mb and 3mb services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on 512k. the cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route. broadband can seem confusing for consumers  with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products  some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and set-up fees. it is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in 2005 but remains a plane worth catching. as it gets faster and offers extras such as cheap telephone calls online  the only real thing to remember for the coming year is to enjoy the ride.,-0.86129713

2104,business,house prices rebound says halifax uk house prices increased by 1.1% in december  the first monthly rise since september  the halifax has said.  the uk s biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1% over the whole of 2004  but by only 2.8% in the second half of the year. the average price of a house in the uk now stands at £162 086  halifax said. the survey seems to fly in the face of recent evidence that the uk housing market has been slowing substantially in response to interest rate rises.  last week  the nationwide said that house prices fell 0.2% in december  with annual inflation running at a three year low.  on tuesday  figures from the bank of england showed that the number of mortgages approved in the uk has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade. new loans in november fell to 77 000  from 85 000 in october  the lowest rate since september 1995  the bank of england said. growth in unsecured lending  such as personal loans and credit cards  also slowed last month. capital economics  which has in the past predicted a sharp fall in uk house prices  branded halifax s findings a  temporary surprise   which would be reversed over the coming months.  the month by month volatility of the halifax house price data should not distract from the fact that there is a clear downward trend in house prices   a capital economics statement said.  experts believe five interest rate rises since november 2003 are cutting borrowers  appetite for debt.  despite recording a price rise in december  the halifax survey concluded that there was  continuing signs of a genuine slowdown in the housing market.  martin ellis  halifax chief economist  said that there was no need to revise the bank s prediction  made last month  that prices would fall by 2% in 2005.  sound housing market fundamentals will continue to underpin the market in 2005  ensuring that the market remains healthy and that house prices fall only slightly   mr ellis said. if the bank s prediction of a 2% price drop comes true  it will be the first annual fall in nine years.  the bank said that the recent pattern of house prices rising the fastest in the north of england continued in december. in the north west and yorkshire and the humber  halifax said prices rose by 3% and 1.2% in the two regions respectively during the month. at the other send of the scale  prices in the south east and london fell by 1.6% and 0.5% respectively. the biggest decline was seen in wales where prices fell by 6.2%  an area that had experienced strong house price growth during most of 2004. overall  halifax said prices in the final quarter of 2004 were 0.1% higher than in the previous quarter. this was the smallest quarterly rise since the second quarter of 2000  the bank said. as a result  annual house price inflation dipped below 20% during the final few months of 2004.,2.3809955

1697,politics,army chiefs in regiments decision military chiefs are expected to meet to make a final decision on the future of scotland s army regiments.  a committee of the army board  which is made up of the most senior defence figures  will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on monday. the proposals include cutting scotland s six single-battalion regiments to five and merging these into a super regiment. the plans have faced stiff opposition from campaigners and politicians alike. the committee s decision must be ratified by defence secretary geoff hoon and prime minister tony blair. it is expected that it will be made public next week. when ministers announced a reorganisation of the army it drew a question mark over the futures of the black watch  the kings own scottish borderers  the royal scots  the royal highland fusiliers and the argyll and sutherland highlanders. in october  the council of scottish colonels proposed the merger of the royal scots and the king s own scottish borderers into a single battalion.  under their vision  it would be one of five in the new super regiment. the proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry  with labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan. they felt the timing was insensitive because the black watch was in the frontline in iraq  suffering casualties. the save the scottish regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against labour at the next general election.  speaking ahead of the expected army board meeting  a spokesman said:  the government and the army board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the scottish regiments are for the good of the army and for that of the serving soldier.  they are very much not for the good and will destroy scotland s regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems  a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to scotland of an important part of her heritage and  most importantly  her future - the regiments are the envy of armies around the world.  an alternative blueprint had been put forward by labour mp eric joyce  who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments. for a brief time  there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan  but that now seems unlikely. speaking in scotland last week  mr blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely. he said:  they don t want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections - far from it  all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly.  the prime minister said he hoped campaigners  concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount.,-4.3863316

618,tech,search wars hit desktop pcs another front in the on-going battle between microsoft and google is about to be opened.  by the end of 2004 microsoft aims to launch search software to find any kind of file on a pc hard drive. the move is in answer to google s release of its own search tool that catalogues data on desktop pcs. the desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded as google  aol  yahoo and many smaller firms tout programs that help people find files.  microsoft made the announcement about its forthcoming search software during a call to financial analysts to talk about its first quarter results. john connors  microsoft s chief financial officer said a test version of its desktop search software should be available for download by the end of the year.   we re going to have a heck of a great race in search between google  microsoft and yahoo   he said.  it s going to be really fun to follow.  microsoft is coming late to the desktop search arena and its software will have to compare favourably with programs from a large number of rivals  many of which have fiercely dedicated populations of users. the program could be based on the software microsoft owns as a result of its purchase of lookout software in early october. on 14 october google released desktop search software that catalogues all the files on a pc and lets users use one tool to find e-mail messages  spreadsheets  text files and presentations. the software will also find webpages and messages sent via aol instant messenger.  many other firms have released desktop search systems recently too. companies such as blinkx  copernic  enfish x1 technologies and x-friend all do the same job of cataloguing the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer.  apple has also debuted a similar search system for its computers called spotlight that is due to debut with the release of the tiger operating system. due to follow are net giants aol and yahoo. the latter recently bought stata labs to get its hands on search software that people can use. microsoft is also reputedly working on a novel search system for the next version of windows (codenamed longhorn). however this is not likely to appear until 2006.  the recent activity in the search industry shows that there is a need to move beyond simple keyword-based web search   said kathy rittweger  co-founder of blinkx.  finding information of our own computers is becoming as difficult as it is to find the relevant webpage amongst the billions that exist.   desktop search has become important for several reasons. according to research by message analysts the radicati group up to 45% of the information critical to keeping many businesses running sits in e-mail messages and attachments. jf sullivan  spokesman for e-mail software firm sendmail said many organisations were starting to realise how important messaging was to their organisation and the way the work.  the key thing is being able to manage all this information   he said. also search is increasingly key to the way that people get around the internet. many people use a search engine as the first page they go to when getting on the net. many others use desktop toolbars that let them search for information no matter what other program they are using. having a tool on a desktop can be a lucrative way to control where people go online. for companies such as google which relies on revenue from adverts this knowledge about what people are looking for is worth huge amounts of money. but this invasiveness has already led some to ask about the privacy implications of such tools.,2.709482

854,business,q&a: malcolm glazer and man utd the battle for control of manchester united has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from us business tycoon malcolm glazer.  no formal offer has been made yet  but manchester united have confirmed they have received a  detailed proposal  from the us entrepreneur which could lead to a bid. reports have put the offer at 300p per share  which would value manchester united at about £800m ($1.5bn). the approach by the 76-year-old owner of the tampa bay buccaneers american football team is reportedly being led by his two sons  avi and joel. a previous approach to the united board by mr glazer in october last year was turned down. however  the bbc has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand.  mr glazer s previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover. that would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed  not... in the best interests of the company  by manchester united s board when they rejected his approach last year. however  mr glazer s latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by £200m.  while united s board may be casting a serious eye over mr glazer s latest proposals  supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal.  supporters  group shareholders united - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to mr glazer s campaign - said it would fight any move.  manchester united are a debt-free company. we don t want to fall into debt and we don t need to fall into debt   shareholders united s sean bones told the bbc. united s players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover.  a lot of people want the club s interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart   rio ferdinand told bbc radio five live.  no-one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table.   the key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of united s largest shareholders  the irish horse racing tycoons john magnier and jp mcmanus. through their cubic expression vehicle they own 28.9% of the club. mr glazer owns 28.1%. joe mclean  a football specialist at accountancy firm grant thornton  said the support of mr magnier and mr mcmanus was  utterly crucial .  mr glazer s bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment.  if that s the case  the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about 300 pence  maybe 305.  if that s the case then mr glazer might well secure their support - if he does  this bid could well go ahead.   indeed it is. malcolm glazer was little-known in the uk until he started to build up his stake in manchester united in late 2003. in february 2004 he said he was  considering  whether to bid for the club. no bid emerged  but mr glazer continued to increase his holding in the club. in october 2004  manchester united said they had received a  preliminary approach   which turned out to have come from mr glazer. however  the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve. at the club s annual general meeting in november  mr glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board. legal adviser maurice watkins  commercial director andy anson and non-executive director philip yea were voted out  against the wishes of chief executive david gill. but the move led to bankers jp morgan and public relations firm brunswick withdrawing from the glazer bid team.,0.6920042
912,tech,confusion over high-definition tv now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital tv  dvds  and digital video recorders  the next revolution for tv is being prepared for our sets.  in most corners of tv and technology industries  high-definition (hdtv) is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour. hd essentially makes tv picture quality at least four times better than now. but there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about hd on the high street. thousands of flat panel screens - lcds (liquid crystal displays)  plasma screens  and dlp rear-projection tv sets - have already been sold as  hd   but are in fact not able to display hd.   the uk is the largest display market in europe   according to john binks  director of gfk  which monitors global consumer markets.  but  he added:  of all the flat panel screens sold  just 1.3% in the uk are capable of getting high-definition.  there are 74 different devices that are being sold as hd but are not hd-ready  according to alexander oudendijk  senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant astra. they may be fantastic quality tvs  but many do not have adaptors in them - called dvi or hdmi (high-definition multimedia interface) connectors - which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images. part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the high street  say industry experts  who gathered at bafta in london for the 2nd european hdtv summit last week.  we have to be careful about consumer confusion. there is a massive education process to go through   said mr binks. the industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of us who will be watching it. eventually  that will be everyone. the bbc is currently developing plans to produce all its tv output to meet hdtv standards by 2010.  preparations for the analogue switch-off are already underway in some areas  and programmes are being filmed with hd cameras. bskyb plans to ship its first generation set-top boxes  to receive hdtv broadcasts  in time for christmas. like its sky+ boxes  they will also be personal video recorders (pvrs). the company will start broadcasts of hdtv programmes  offering them as  premium channel packages   concentrating  to start with  on sports  big events  and films  in early 2006. but the set-top box which receives hdtv broadcasts has to plug into a display - tv set - that can show the images at the much higher resolution that hd demands  if hdtv is to be  real . by 2010  20% of homes in the uk will have some sort of tv set or display that can show hd in its full glory.  but it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to  being digital . as a result  all the key players  those who make flat panel displays  as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters  formed a hd forum in 2004 to make sure they were all talking to each other. part of the forum has been concerned with issues like industry standards and content protection. but it has also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for.  from next month  all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a  hd-ready  sticker. this also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and hdtv signals  and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry.  the logo is absolutely the way forward   said david mercer  analysts with strategy analytics.  but it is still not appearing on many retail products.  the industry is upbeat that the sticker will help  but it is only a start.  we can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers   said mr oudendijk.  there may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months.  the european broadcast union (ebu) is testing different flavours of hd formats to prepare for even better hdtv further down the line. it is similarly concerned that people get the right information on hdtv formats  as well as which devices will support the formats.  we believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile   said phil laven  technical director for the ebu. the tv display manufacturers want us to watch hd on screens that are at least 42in (106cm)  to get the  true impact  of hd  they say  although smaller displays suffice. what may convince people to spend money on hd-ready devices is the falling prices  which continue to tumble across europe. the prices are dropping an average of 20% every year  according to analysts. lcd prices dropped by 43% in europe as a whole last year  according to mr oudendijk.,1.7500787
471,sport,parry puts gerrard  above money  listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from 1900 gmt.  but parry  speaking exclusively to bbc sport  also admits gerrard  who has been constantly linked with chelsea  will have the final say on his future. he told bbc five live:  steven is above money. he is the future of liverpool.  it doesn t matter if it s £30m  £40m or £50m  we will not accept offers. but we are also realistic enough to know we can t keep steven against his will.  on the subject of liverpool s finances  parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium.  and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen  he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing  but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan. parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from a similar role at the premier league. there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield - and he had a busy summer  overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard.  on the subject of liverpool s captain and prize asset  parry revealed real madrid  did  ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes. he said:  they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes  but the response to real madrid was the same - steven is not for sale.  but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season  parry said:  i sincerely hope he will be. steven knows my views. he knows rafa s views.  we have re-affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him. we crave success as much as he does. we know he s ambitious and nobody can argue with that.   i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he d like to do anything else.  we all want to see progress by next season. he s not alone in that. there are a lot of other players who feel the same  so we all have a common aim.  it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a £30m-plus bid in the summer - but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen.  there have been a lot of open secrets about steven  most of which have been complete myths. it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. we didn t had an offer last summer   parry explained.  we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn t want to sell him. in reality it didn t go beyond that.  maybe there will be an offer in the summer. maybe there won t.   our position is we want steven to stay  but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial.  you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will. that just doesn t work  but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him  by the way we ve decided to sell you  is not on the agenda. you can forget that.  parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool s new stadium in stanley park  which is set to open in 2007. and he confessed arsenal s £100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the anfield club serious food for thought. he said:  i have to say historically it is something i have been against  and i have been on record as saying that  but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eye-opener.   i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn t even been worth contemplating.  but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say  wow - that s interesting.   my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium.  some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial  but parry countered:  i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters  but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team.  if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it  time will tell.  i think the stadium will always be anfield  not least because of where it is  but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship  i think it would be remiss not to.  that s not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road  but i think it is clearly something we have to explore.   on the subject of possible new investment  parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor  with rumours of interest from the middle east. that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan  who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. he also accused liverpool of using him as  a stalking horse  to attract other bids  but parry explained:  steve has never been used as a stalking horse. there s no need  and that is not the way we do business.  we had discussions with steve over the course of 2004. i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn t happen.  quite genuinely  the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december  and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude  and that potential is so exciting  we felt we had to evaluate it. we are still evaluating it.  steve s interest was taken very much on its own merits. his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold   the door isn t closed on anything. we had a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year.  we have a common interest in making liverpool successful. that s a dream we all share  so as far as i m concerned the door is not closed.   i would take £50m if we had no investment  but if we did  keep him. as for the stadium  if it gets us cash what difference does it make really   £50m for gerrard  i don t care who you are  the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. we cannot let that sum of money go  despite gerrard s quality.  through a cleverly worded statement  the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself  which i think is the right thing to do.  critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard. ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. i am hoping he doesn t walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash.  £50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad  however  if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it. i would however be happy with gerrard s transfer for any fee over £35m.  parry s statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. upping the ante is another smart move by parry.  i would keep gerrard. no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.  the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. clearly  if he isn t  then we would be foolish not to sell. the worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-champions league football.,0.10067701
1638,sport,a november to remember last saturday  one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world.  that statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham. but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level  at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series. the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion  with australia s triumph in london followed by france s capitulation to new zealand.  clearly  there is no number one side in the world at the moment   declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney.  there are four  five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1%.   while that bodes well for rugby as a whole  it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for a decade. while the wallabies  all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super 12 matters in the new year  europe s finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray. and for the first time in more than a decade  it will not simply be a straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title.  that owes much to ireland s continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays.    who secured a first triple crown in 19 years last season  could go one better and win their first five/six nations title since 1985. they start with away games against italy and scotland  before england and france come to lansdowne road.  their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster ireland s self-belief  while ronan o gara s late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie o sullivan s side can now close out tight games. not that england or france  who have won nine of the last 10 six nations titles between them  will lay down quietly.  dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio  they still have the personnel to prosper.  the narrow defeat to australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden  but the fresh shoots of post-world cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson. a fresh desire to regain former heights is evident  and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff  a fourth title in six years is within reach.  are in familiar revival territory  but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style.  while south africa s over-confidence in cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected  wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory. if mike ruddock can coax a reliable set-piece platform from his pack  there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february. the last fortnight has left  in a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over australia. a stunning defeat to argentina  their first loss since the world cup  could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency.  but the manner of new zealand s 45-6 demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard. fortunately for the french  the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining  in paris. after two reasonable performances against australia  the scots  humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent. while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations  a lack of top-class players will continue to undermine their best efforts.    who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland  are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship. as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime  the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february.,0.65492535
2022,business,us data sparks inflation worries wholesale prices in the us rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in january  according to government data.  new figures show the labor department producer price index (ppi) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. but core producer prices  which exclude food and energy costs  surged by 0.8%  the biggest rise since december 1998  increasing inflationary concerns. in contrast  the university of michigan barometer of us retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. the university s index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early february from 95.5 in january  which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the us public. the mixed set of data on friday led to volatile early wall street trade  as the dow jones  standard and poor s 500  and nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.  the economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the federal reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. the fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since june 2004  in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.  mr greenspan told congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures.  the ppi would argue for greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace   said joe quinlan  chief market stategist at bank of america capital management.  but this michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.   consumer spending accounts for 66% of us economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy  which is why the michigan data is closely observed. however on friday  it was overshadowed by the core ppi core figure  which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months  the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years.  the concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core ppi as an impetus for the fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates   said paul cherney  chief market analyst at standard & poor s. but ian shepherdson  chief us economist at high frequency economics  said the ppi report was  much less alarming  than at first glance. one-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices  which  are no indication of broad ppi pressure   were responsible for the increase  he said. prices for autos and trucks also jumped in january  but shepherdson said  it is a good bet these increases won t stick .,1.5413346

206,politics,lib dems highlight problem debt people vulnerable to problem debts should be afforded greater protection from banks aggressively promoting financial products  the lib dems say.  vincent cable says one in eight households already struggle with debt and that will worsen if there is a hike in interest rates or unemployment. the lib dems  treasury spokesman is unveiling a policy aimed at the issue. he wants to see  proper health checks  when loans are marketed so people know to take out payment protection.   were economic conditions to deteriorate at all  large numbers of people could be affected because they have borrowed to the limit   mr cable told bbc news.  banks are very aggressively promoting debt in many cases there is a bigger problem ahead.  mr cable said the government s consumer credit bill would target some of the  extreme problems  such as loan sharking  but ministers had been  a bit complacent  about the wider issue of debt levels. he said much of the payment protection currently available was  extremely expensive  and there were  lots of exclusions .  mr cable added that the office of fair trading should investigate the market. lib dem leader charles kennedy meanwhile is in the middle of a tour of the uk aimed at persuading voters his is the  real opposition . mr kennedy is visiting a mixture of rural seats  where his party is hoping to make gains from the conservatives  and urban areas traditionally associated with labour. labour say a lib dem vote could  let the tories in   while the tories say the lib dems would mean  higher taxes  soft crime laws  more power to europe . mr kennedy s tour comes as he  labour leader tony blair and conservative leader michael howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next general election  widely expected to be held on 5 may.  the liberal democrats say in the northern cities  the race is between them and labour  while in southern seats - particularly the south west - it is between them and the tories. speaking to the bbc s westminster hour on sunday  mr kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for 5 may - would be much more unpredictable than any others in  recent experience . and he brushed off labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the tories in  by the back door .  if you look at the four previous parliamentary by-elections  the liberal democrats have demonstrated that  not only can we leapfrog the conservatives where we start in a third place position  but we can go on to defeat the government.  that s going to be the story  i think  of this coming general election.,-1.618381
1695,politics,new  yob  targets to be unveiled fifty new areas getting special help to fight anti-social behaviour in england and wales will be named on thursday.  ten areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. a year ago  ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and thursday s figures offer a progress check. they will say that in the past year more than 2 600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.  police have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders  breaking up groups of youths in public places. the 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. exeter and cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved.  prime minister tony blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of asbos and fixed penalty notices. there are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly.  he is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed.  we have not defeated this problem by any means  but shown together what can be done   he will say. mr blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws  saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance.  ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25 000 community support officers (csos). but researchers from leeds university warned that csos could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. more work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before csos  they argued in a the study. critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. home office minister hazel blears also revealed this week that  about a third  of asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.,1.8138127

1310,business,fosters buys stake in winemaker australian brewer fosters has bought a large stake in australian winemaker southcorp  sparking rumours of a possible takeover.  fosters bought 18.8% of southcorp  the global winemaker behind the penfolds  lindemans and rosemount brands  for 4.17 australian dollars per share. a bid at that price would value the company at a$3.1bn ($2.4bn; £1.25bn ). fosters said it was currently in discussions  which may lead to a major corporate announcement .  in a separate statement  southcorp confirmed the brewer had asked for talks. both firms asked the sydney stock market to suspend trading in their shares until monday. southcorp s shares were suspended at a$4.25.  fosters bought the 18.8% stake from reline investments  the family investment firm for the oatleys  who founded the rosemount estates label and sold it to southcorp in 2001. robert oatley and his son sandy oatley have both resigned from southcorp s board following the share deal. southcorp employs 2 700 people and is the largest single investor in rural australia  according to its website. the prospect of fosters launching a major acquisition startled investors  as the brewer said last summer that it was not looking to expand through a big buy in the near future. it has cash available  after getting a$846m from selling property business lensworth  but it has been widely expected to return cash to shareholders.   people will scratching their heads over this one. fosters has done a back-flip   said shawn burns  a fund manger at deutsche asset management. southcorp s shares have risen in recent months on speculation that it could become a takeover target. it spent two years in the red  returning to profit in 2004. consolidation in the wine industry is being driven by constellation  the world s biggest winemaker. it seized the top spot when it bought australian firm brl hardy for just over $1bn in 2003. since then  it has paid $1bn for us wine maker robert mondavi  bought last month. fosters  main wine business is beringer blass wine estate. its best known brand is fosters lager  though it makes a clutch of beer brands  and spirits. analysts were divided on thursday about whether fosters was more likely to go for a takeover or merely wanted to take a big enough chunk of southcorp to prevent it falling to a rival.  currently  i think the strategic position is more sensible rather than an outright takeover   said one analyst quoted by the agence france presse news agency. however  matt williams  a fund manager at perpetual trustees said taking the stake  is definitely a precursor to a takeover .,-0.51674986

907,politics,butler launches attack on blair former civil service chief lord butler has criticised the way tony blair s government operates  accusing it of being obsessed with headlines.  he also attacked the way the iraq war was  sold  to the public  with important warnings on the strength of the intelligence left out. tory leader michael howard said lord butler had given the  most damaging testimony  he could remember. but downing street said mr blair should be judged by results not his style.  lord butler said mr blair bypassed the cabinet and relied instead on small  informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions. the prime minister s official spokesman said the cabinet was still used to achieve a consensus on important issues. but he added:  you cannot  in a modern government  take every decision in cabinet. it s just not possible.   lord butler said the government had too much freedom to  bring in bad bills  and  to do whatever it likes  and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees. the former cabinet secretary said in an interview with the spectator magazine:  i would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling  there is too much central control and there is too little of what i would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments.  mr howard described lord butler s intervention as  very important .  this is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the blair government.  it is certainly the most damaging testimony i can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position.   lord butler s report earlier this year into iraq intelligence said the government s september 2002 weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was  very thin . the reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers  case for war  lord butler said in his spectator interview  which was conducted by the magazine s editor  conservative mp boris johnson. he said:  when civil servants give material to ministers  they say these are the conclusions we ve drawn  but we ve got to tell you the evidence we ve got is pretty thin.  similarly  if you are giving something to the united nations and the country you should warn them.   asked why he thought the warnings were not there lord butler said:  one has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was. the purpose of the dossier was to persuade the british why the government thought iraq was a very serious threat.   when asked whether he thought the country was well-governed on the whole  he replied:  well. i think we are a country where we suffer very badly from parliament not having sufficient control over the executive  and that is a very grave flaw.  we should be breaking away from the party whip. the executive is much too free to bring in a huge number of extremely bad bills  a huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes - and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow.  all that is part of what is bad government in this country.  lord butler s assessment was backed by his predecessor as cabinet secretary  lord armstrong. lord armstrong told bbc two s newsnight:  i agree ... there doesn t appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decision-making that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect.  liberal democrat deputy leader menzies campbell said he thought lord butler s comments were  well justified  and mr blair s style of leadership was  corrosive of the whole system of government . but labour former minister jack cunningham accused lord butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming labour administration  when he was cabinet secretary. mr cunningham told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  taken together  robin butler s comments are partial  inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the labour government.,1.152988

902,tech,mobiles  not media players yet  mobiles are not yet ready to be all-singing  all-dancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players  say two reports.  despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles  people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life  said jupiter. a separate study by gartner has also said real-time tv broadcasts to mobiles is  unlikely  in europe until 2007. technical issues and standards must be resolved first  said the report. batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer  like video playback  video messaging  megapixel cameras and games amongst others. bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life.  fifty percent of europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone  but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets.  mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready   said thomas husson  mobile analyst at jupiter research.  mobile music services should be new and different  and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches.  other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones  compared to portable players which can hold up to 40gb of music. the mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading  after the success of apple s itunes  napster and other net music download services.  with phones getting smarter and more powerful  there are also demands to be able to watch tv on the move. in the us  services like tivo to go let people transfer pre-recorded tv content onto their phones. but  the gartner report on mobile tv broadcasting in europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. currently  tv-like services  where clips are downloaded  are offered by several european operators  like italy s tim and 3. mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though  said the report.  various standards and ways of getting tv signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. in europe  trials in berlin and helsinki are making use of terrestrial tv masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. a service from the norwegian broadcasting corporation lets people watch tv programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day. the service uses 3gp technology  one of the standards for mobile tv. but at the end of 2004  the european telecommunications institute (etsi) formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld (dvb-h) as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe. operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles  as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. the cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. handsets also need to be able to work with the dvb-h standard. tv services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation too  which expects good quality images at low prices  according to analysts. people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens  said gartner. digital video recorders  like europe s sky+ box  and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch. as a result  people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control. more powerful smartphones like the xda ii  nokia 6600  sonyericsson p900 and the orange e200  offering web access  text and multimedia messaging  e-mail  calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. a report by analysts instat/mdr has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44% over the next five years. it says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009.,0.95435476
800,tech,more women turn to net security older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks  according to a two-year study.  the number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus  spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. the study  for net security firm preventon  shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. it is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. for the last three years  that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. but more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. the research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users  as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers.  the study predicts that 40% of all home pc net security buyers will be women in 2005. they could even overtake men as the main buyers by 2007  if current rates persist  according to the research.  i think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their pcs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong   said one over-60 woman who took part in the research.   you started off with young male stereotype computer users for last 10 years   paul goosens  head of preventon told the bbc news website.  now we are seeing real people - both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home.  but net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online  particuarly if they are new to broadband  he said.  programs also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dial-up users with a slower connection too  said mr goosens. security software should be easy to use  with simple interfaces and instructions written in non-technical language  he added. the nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about e-mail viruses. high-profile complaints about rogue diallers  and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers  have also raised awareness about the need to have a combination of anti-virus  firewall and spyware-removal programs too. without protection  these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally.  more than 30 000 pcs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses  a study from security from symantec showed last year. viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer  according to net security experts. programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs  many based in eastern europe  over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance. the research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because  said mr goosens  they are reported in the press much more.  you are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat. they are asking the right questions   he explained.  it is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using a reputable service provider  that they are safe to connect to the net.  an unprotected computer on a broadband connection can be breached and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes. by the end of the year it is thought that more than 30% of uk homes will have broadband net access. in july last year  the number of uk households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time  according to the office of national statistics.,-0.8033843

534,politics,scots smoking ban details set out smoke-free areas will save lives and improve scotland s health  first minister jack mcconnell has insisted.  he told the scottish parliament on wednesday that a  comprehensive ban  on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. mr mcconnell said the country s health rates were  lamentable  not least because of smoking. he said fines of up to £2 500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. earlier  the scottish executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. in a statement to parliament  mr mcconnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.  the health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost  he told msps. he said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby  tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of europe image becomes a thing of the past .  there are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health   he declared.  health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise  drugs abuse  excessive drinking and over-eating.  they all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in europe  and too many smoke.  it is clear that scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.  the legislation will be introduced as part of the health service (miscellaneous provisions) bill  which will be considered by parliament before christmas. main points of the plan:    - a comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in scotland   - the legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers   - licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2 500   - licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence   - a system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined   - individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1 000.     mr mcconnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. he said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in new york and 16% in ireland. mr mcconnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from new york bars and restaurants and  in ireland  only a one point three per cent volume sales fall  where they were declining before the ban. the afternoon announcement  following a cabinet meeting on wednesday morning  won broad support from opposition parties.  the scottish national party s holyrood leader  nicola sturgeon  welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. she said:  the time has come for a ban on smoking in public places.  there is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit.  but we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.  the scottish conservative party leader  david mcletchie  questioned what would be exempted from the ban. he was keen to know if inmates in scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. mr mcletchie asked:  would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister s brave new scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals   the scottish green party s health spokeswoman  eleanor scott  said she was pleased scotland would be following the  success stories of new york and ireland . she believed the majority of people in scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.,0.5233269

1520,sport,umaga ready for lions all blacks captain tama umaga has warned the british and irish lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour.  but umaga  in england for saturday s irb rugby aid match  also backed new zealand to win the three-test series against the lions. he told bbc sport:  it s potentially the most fearsome line-up i ve ever come up against. they re awesome.  but i d back us all the way to beat them when they come over.  lions boss sir clive woodward is set to announce his squad for the june-july tour next month.  when woodward was appointed last year  it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former england players. but umaga said:  he d be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the six nations.  don t get me wrong  england have got a lot of talented guys and i m sure there are some of them who ll make the lions test xv.  but you can t disguise wales and ireland in particular. some of the tries they ve scored have been great. i ll admit it ll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of brian o driscoll.   umaga will meet o driscoll in saturday s rugby aid match at twickenham  with the irish captain leading the northern hemisphere side. o driscoll is among a host of players in the northern hemisphere squad  coached by woodward  that are tipped for lions call-ups.  it ll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys  although a lot can change between now and june   umaga said. the 31-year-old admitted interest in the lions tour was immense  calling it  the biggest thing to hit new zealand since lord of the rings . he added:  as players  it s enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the lions. in fact  it s not just us all blacks - it s the talk of the country.   umaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of saturday s charity game  which features a host of big names including george gregan  andrew mehrtens and chris latham. but he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over.  the second [southern hemisphere coach] rod macqueen made the approach  i didn t hesitate. it was great when new zealand rugby then gave me the all clear.  thankfully i didn t know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn t miss all the horrific reports on the news.  there are so many people that were affected  are still affected and will be affected for a long time. it s just good to know we can do something minor to help out.   - the match will be televised on bbc one at 1400 gmt on saturday.,1.3530254
851,business,japan s ageing workforce: built to last in his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years  then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties. and the 101-year-old torao toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life.  mr toshitsune is one of japan s 23 000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually  and where the oldest member is 114. at his neat osaka detached house  where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters  mr toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional japanese tea ceremony. between tasks  this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is:  well  what s most important for me is to be japan s number one.  mr toshitsune wants to outlive everyone. and when it comes to longevity  japan  as a country  appears to be doing just that. women can expect to live until 85  men until 78  four years longer than americans and europeans.  on the outskirts of kyoto  83-year-old yuji shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends  who are in their seventies.   i think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved   he remarks.  on average  we can live longer.  whether it s the diet  or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined  or just something in the genes  japan s elderly are remarkable. but while life may be a game of golf for mr shimizu  his grandchildren have huge problems ahead. japan is the world s least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the us.  by 2007  japan s population is expected to peak at 127 million  then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century. this means 30 million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled.   in the year 2050  if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will make up over 30% of the population   explains shigeo morioka of the international longevity centre in tokyo. so how will japan s finances stay on track  after a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending  the public sector debt is already about 140% of the country s gross domestic product (gdp)  the highest rate among industrialised countries. the international monetary fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010  the cost of running japan s welfare state will double to more than 5% of gdp  while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%. but unfortunately  japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically. glen wood  vice president of deutsche securities japan  asks;  who s going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new japanese worker   who is going to build the economy  who are going to be the leaders  who are going to be the producers of the gdp going forward   one option is further welfare reform. another is immigration  possibly from the philippines and indonesia. but so far  any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff.  standing next to tokyo harbour is a version of new york s statue of liberty. but  as yet  japan is not ready for an ellis island.   japan has never really liked that option in its history and i think it s an option that s becoming more and more plausible and necessary   insists mr wood. in japan  as in europe which also faces a workforce decline  immigration is a very sensitive subject. but for the japanese economy  facing 8% fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars  hi-tech kit and home appliances  perhaps even another property crash.  of course the japanese could always have more children. the government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in australia. but there would be no pay back until 2030  when today s babies are taxpayers  and the demographic crisis  like in europe  starts to unfold in 2010. in contrast to japan - and of course the european union - the us population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century. although president bush must re-devise social security to take account of a 130% rise in america s over 65s  the imf foresees a positive contribution to the us current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration.  some voices in japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the japanese labour market. they want a shift towards financial services  though doubts persist over the country s ability  let alone willingness  to move away from manufacturing.  japan still has problems getting a viable banking system  let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas   says mr wood. japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession. falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency. come 2020  japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power. there are fears that the world s number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession. but none of this is mr toshitsune s concern anymore. at 101  he chuckles that  he feels fine.,-0.5294485
936,sport,charvis set to lose fitness bid flanker colin charvis is unlikely to play any part in wales  final two games of the six nations.  charvis has missed all three of wales  victories with an ankle injury and his recovery has been slower than expected.  he will not figure in the scotland game and is now thought unlikely to be ready for the final game   said wales physio mark davies. sonny parker is continuing to struggle with a neck injury  but hal luscombe should be fit for the murrayfield trip. centre parker has only a  slim chance  of being involved against the scots on 13 march  so luscombe s return to fitness after missing the france match with hamstring trouble is a timely boost.  said wales assistant coach scott johnson:  we re positive about hal and hope he ll be raring to go.  he comes back into the mix again  adds to the depth and gives us other options.   replacement hooker robin mcbryde remains a doubt after picking up knee ligament damage in paris last saturday.  we re getting that reviewed and we should know more by the end of the week how robin s looking   added johnson.  we re hopeful but it s too early to say at this stage.  steve jones from the dragons is likely to be drafted in if mcbryde fails to recover.,2.4770925

2125,politics,analysis: no pain  no gain  he called it his  masochism strategy  in the run-up to the iraq war and now tony blair has signed up for another dose of pain.  the idea is simple - the prime minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of  real  voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras. the theory is that talking to the great british public  even if they are the  great unwashed   is better than having the media filter what voters hear from politicians. it is also the most effective way of showing that he is aware of real people s concerns and - on occasions - of their outright fury. mr blair used the tactic before the iraq war to try to show he really was engaging with public concerns and you can expect to see it much more in the run-up to the election.  labour knows it has been damaged by accusations of spin   control freakery  and over-slick presentation - sometimes from within the ranks of its own mps. tony blair himself has said people complain he does not listen. mr blair s latest bout of flagellation came with a series of questions sessions on five television throughout wednesday.  the trouble began on the wright stuff show  with maria hutchings marching up to him  saying  tony  that s rubbish  as she tried to complain about her autistic son s school being threatened with closure. a few  don t worries  as mrs hutchings was led back to the audience averted a public slanging match - he spoke to her privately after the show. but that was only the start and later sessions produced the type of grilling not even the toughest television interviewer could produce.  writer neil coppendale  from west sussex  asked of the iraq war:  tens of thousands of innocent men  women and children died - how do you manage to sleep at night   on immigration  london teacher diane granger said:  where are you going to put everyone   and can you imagine even jeremy paxman putting the question posed by brighton nurse marion brown:  would you wipe somebody s backside for £5    mr blair tried to use the questioners  first names - and sometimes threw them off their stride by asking what they would do about the problems. many of the newspapers have branded the exercise a pr stunt which backfired. indeed there is a danger mr blair simply ends up looking  embattled . conservative michael howard and liberal democrat charles kennedy are to be offered chances to appear in similar slots on the channel next month. labour strategists believe more of the sessions will mean the hecklers no longer become a story and the real issues take prominence.  james humphreys  ex-head of corporate communications at number 10  says the strategy shows frustration with the media.  they feel they don t get their voice across and going direct to people is clearly their game on this occasion   he says. there are risks but the prize is tackling the trend of lower turnouts at the polls  he argues. the prime minister knows full well the potential hazards .  he must remember with gritted teeth his confrontation with sharron storer  the birmingham woman who harangued him over the state of her local hospital in the 2001 election campaign.  all you do is walk around and make yourself known  you don t do anything to help anybody   she told mr blair before stomping off  refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately. former downing street media chief alastair campbell has described the episode as a  bit of a disaster  as it meant the launch of labour s election manifesto received little coverage. but it was seen as one of the few moments when that election campaign came alive  not least because it coincided with john prescott s even more direct contact - when he punched an egg-throwing protester.  former prime ministers too have come to grief at the hands of a persistent member of the public. the undoubted highlight of years of election phone-in shows was margaret thatcher discomfort on nationwide in 1983  when viewer diana gould put her on the spot about the sinking of the belgrano in the falklands war. john major reaped the benefits of street campaigning during the 1992 election campaign with his famous soapbox.  it may have left him splattered with eggs and engine oil at times but he felt it added  fizz  to his campaign. in his memoirs  he also argues the strategy contrasted with neil kinnock s  contrived photo opportunities  and attempts at an artful campaign.  he wanted to look like a prime minister. i  was  prime minister and i wanted a flesh and blood fight   says mr major. mr blair told prospective labour mps on thursday that taking part in phone-ins and public meetings could  enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment . but he also wants to counter complaints that he has spent too much time on international affairs and foreign trips. mr blair recalls how bill clinton once advised him:  always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day.  his hope must be that voters watching him on the rack will bear out for labour the old maxim:  no pain  no gain.,0.5840516

1970,sport,balco case trial date pushed back the trial date for the bay area laboratory cooperative (balco) steroid distribution case has been postponed.  us judge susan illston pushed back a preliminary evidentiary hearing - which was due to take place on wednesday - until 6 june. no official trial date has been set but it is expected to begin in september. balco founder victor conte along with james valente  coach remy korchemny and trainer greg anderson are charged with distributing steroids to athletes.  anderson s clients include barry bonds  and several other baseball stars have been asked to appear before a congressional inquiry into steroid use in the major leagues. the balco defence team have already lost their appeal to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in san francisco but will still argue the case should not go to trial. the hearing in june will focus on the admissibility of evidence gathered during police raids on balco s offices and anderson s home. conte and anderson were not arrested at that point but federal agents did obtain statements from them. the defence are expected to challenge the legality of those interviews and if ilston agrees she could could reject all the evidence from the raids. balco has been accused by the united states anti-doping agency (usada) of being the source of the banned steroid thg and modafinil.  former double world champion kelli white and olympic relay star alvin harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the balco investigation. britain s former european 100m champion dwain chambers is currently serving a two-year ban after testing positive for thg in an out-of-competition test in 2003. and american sprinter marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.,2.0333574
2160,tech,peer-to-peer nets  here to stay  peer-to-peer (p2p) networks are here to stay  and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms  says a panel of industry experts.  once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year  firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology. the expert panel probed the future of p2p at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january. the first convictions for p2p piracy were handed out in the us in january. william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music  movies and software. since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down  the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology  blaming it for falling sales and piracy. but that is going to change very soon  according to the panel.  the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks. but they have slowly realised that p2p is a good way to distribute content  said travis kalanick  founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh  and soon they are all going to want a slice of it. they are just waiting to come up with  business models  that work for them  which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards.  but  until the legal actions are resolved  experimentation with p2p cannot not happen  said michael weiss  president of streamcast networks. remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out  mr weiss said:  old media always tries to stop new media.  when they can t stop it  they try to control it. then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money.  once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology  the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business. in august 2004  the san francisco-based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast  two file-sharing networks. the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the 1980s vcr battle  and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal.  p2p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files. instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients. there are now many different types of p2p systems than work in different ways. p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file  like photos  free software  licensed music and any other digital content. the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology. it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them. the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control. but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many. the global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month  and about half a million films are downloaded a day. legal music download services  like apple itunes  napster  have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content. sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004  with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months  the ifpi reported this week. but such download services are very different from p2p networks  not least because of the financial aspect.  there are several money-spinning models that could turn p2p into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies. paid-for-pass-along  in which firms receive money each time a file is shared  along with various drm solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered.  we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p   said marc morgenstern  vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer.   consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together   agreed mr morgenstern. but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry s potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations. unsigned bands  for example  use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively  which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign.  increasingly  what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content   said derek broes  from microsoft.  they will probably play an increasing role in helping p2p spread   he said. looking into p2p s future  file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks  as far as mr broes is concerned.  once some of these issues are resolved  you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content  but also in ways that are unimaginable now   he said.  file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg.,1.4519022

322,business,bank opts to leave rates on hold the bank of england has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.  the bank s monetary policy committee (mpc) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. but some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. interest rates rose five times between november 2003 and august 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. bank of england governor mervyn king has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month s economic data  suggesting the mpc is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. economists see next week s inflation report from the mpc as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.  slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the mpc that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. inflation  however  has been rising faster than expected  hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in december - its highest level in six months. data on wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since may last month  reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.  and recent house surveys from the halifax and nationwide have indicated prices are still rising  albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. philip shaw  chief economist at investec securities  said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike.  the economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months    he said.  growth appears stronger and the mpc may become more concerned about inflation trends.  howard archer  economist at global insight said the mpc  may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside .  business groups welcomed the mpc s widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. the british chambers of commerce (bcc) said it was  concerned by the clamour in some quarters  for early interest rate increases.  we believe that these demands should be firmly resisted   said david frost  bcc director general.  manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly  in spite of the recent revised figures.  ian mccafferty  chief economist at the cbi  said the mpc faced an  interesting  challenge.  consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period  and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling   he said.  however  the broader economy continues to show healthy growth  and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.,2.7610784

1656,business,egypt and israel seal trade deal in a sign of a thaw in relations between egypt and israel  the two countries have signed a trade protocol with the us  allowing egyptian goods made in partnership with israeli firms free access to american markets.  the protocol  signed in cairo  will establish what are called  qualified industrial zones  in egypt. products from these zones will enjoy duty free access to the us  provided that 35% of their components are the product of israeli-egyptian cooperation. the us describes this as the most important economic agreement between egypt and israel in two decades.  the protocol establishing the zones has been stalled for years. there has been deep sensitivity in egypt about any form of co-operation with israel as long as its peace process with the palestinians remains blocked. but in recent weeks an unusual warmth has crept into relations between the two countries. both exchanged prisoners earlier this month  with egypt handing back an israeli who has served eight years in prison after being convicted for spying.  egyptian president hosni mubarak has described israeli prime minister ariel sharon as the best chance for the palestinians to achieve peace. the government in cairo now believes mr sharon is moving towards the centre and away from the positions of right wing groups. it also believes the us  pressed by europe  is now more willing to engage seriously in the search for a settlement. but there are also pressing economic reasons for egypt s decision to enter into the trade agreement. it will give a huge boost to egyptian textile exports  which are about to suffer a drop after new regulations come into force in the us at the beginning of the year.,-2.838705
837,business,sec to rethink post-enron rules the us stock market watchdog s chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new us corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.  in a speech at the london school of economics  william donaldson promised  several initiatives . european firms have protested that us laws introduced after the enron scandal make wall street listings too costly. the us regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the sarbanes-oxley act.  the act comes into force in mid-2005. it obliges all firms with us stock market listings to make declarations  which  critics say  will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.  firms that break the new law could face huge fines  while senior executives risk jail terms of up to 20 years. mr donaldson said that although the act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms  the securities and exchange commission (sec) would  continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements . there are few  if any  who disagree with the intentions of the act  which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts. but european firms with secondary listings in new york have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. the act also applies to firms with more than 300 us shareholders  a situation many firms without us listings could find themselves in.  the 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy  a delisting. mr donaldson said the sec would  consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process  for foreign firms unwilling to meet us requirements.   we should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections  without turning the us market into  one with no exit   he said. he revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the act s least popular measure - section 404 - for foreign firms. seen as particularly costly to implement  section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm s internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. the sec has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including us ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (£374m).  a delegation of european firms visited the sec in december to press for change  the financial times reported.  it was led by digby jones  director general of the uk s confederation of british industry (cbi) and included representatives of basf  siemens and cadbury schweppes. compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of us listings. air china picked the london stock exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (£558m) stock market debut last month. there are also rumours that two chinese state-run banks - china construction bank and bank of china - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in new york later this year. instead  the cost of sarbanes-oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in hong kong  according to press reports in china.,0.9203191

the same quarter of the draw and could face andy roddick in the second round if he beats swede jonas bjorkman. local favourite lleyton hewitt will meet france s arnaud clement  while defending champion and world number one roger federer faces fabrice santoro. women s top seed lindsay davenport drew spanish veteran conchita martinez.  henman came from two sets down to defeat saulnier in the first round of the french open last year  so he knows he faces a tough test in melbourne. the seventh seed  who has never gone beyond the quarter-finals in the year s first major and is lined up to meet roddick in the last eight  is looking forward to the match.  he s tough player on any surface  he s got a lot of ability   he said.  we had a really tight one in paris that went my way so i m going to need to play well from the outset because he s a dangerous competitor.  switzerland s federer  seeded one  is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in 2004. he has beaten santoro in five of their seven previous encounters  but is taking nothing for granted.  it s a tricky match   federer said.  i played him at the us open and won quite comfortably then. but you never know  if the rhythm is a bit off  he can keep you guessing and make it difficult.  the most important thing  though  is to get used to playing five-set matches and winning them.  the 23-year-old could meet four-time champion andre agassi in the quarter-finals before meeting russian marat safin  the player he beat in last year s final.  eighth-seeded american agassi is set to play a qualifier in round one if he can shake off a hip injury which ruled him out of the kooyong classic. second seed andy roddick will open his campaign against irakli labadze of georgia. the american could meet rusedski in the second round  seventh seed henman in the quarter-finals and hewitt in the last four. hewitt is hoping to become the first australian man to win the event since mark edmondson in 1976. the 23-year-old has never been beyond round four in eight attempts at melbourne park but has at least secured the opposite half of the draw to federer  who beat him in the australian open  wimbledon and us open last year. safin  seeded four  opens his campaign against a qualifier with 16th seed tommy haas  the player he beat in the semi-finals in 2002  a possible fourth-round opponent.  in the

the 2000 australian open champion  out of her sydney quarter-final on thursday. venus williams  who lost to younger sister serena in the melbourne final two years ago  opens against eleni daniilidou

930,tech,apple attacked over sources row civil liberties group the electronic frontier foundation (eff) has joined a legal fight between three us online journalists and apple.  apple wants the reporters to reveal 20 sources used for stories which leaked information about forthcoming products  including the mac mini. the eff  representing the reporters  has asked california s superior court to stop apple pursuing the sources. it argues that the journalists are protected by the american constitution. the eff says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press.  apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named asteroid and has asked the journalists  e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that.  rather than confronting the issue of reporter s privilege head-on  apple is going to the journalist s isps for his e-mails   said eff lawyer kurt opsahl.  this undermines a fundamental first amendment right that protects all reporters.  if the court lets apple get away with this  and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters  potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news  analysis and commentary   he said. the case began in december 2004 when apple asked a local californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites appleinsider.com and powerpage.org.  apple also sent requested information from the nfox.com  the internet service provider of powerpage s publisher jason o-grady. as well as looking at how far corporations can go in preventing information from being published  the case will also examine whether online journalists have the same privileges and protections as those writing for newspapers and magazines. the eff has gained some powerful allies in its legal battle with apple  including professor tom goldstein  former dean of the journalism school at the university of california and dan gillmor  a well-known silicon valley journalist. apple was not immediately available for comment.,4.1834993

thinkvantage computer  a dell optiplex  or one of a whole range of laptops from toshiba  hp/compaq or samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised. inside your shiny new pc is an extra chip called the trusted platform module (tpm) that can be used for a range of hardware-based security features. eventually the tpm will be built into the main processor itself  and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own  from mobile phones to tv set top boxes to children s toys. but for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware  providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them. and as part of a well-designed network system  it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today. a big advantage of the tpm is that it is hardware-based.  at the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure. it might be password-protected user accounts  data encryption programs or a firewall  but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor.  hardware security is less common  even if it is a lot safer. this is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password  but also because its more work for users  systems administrators and managers. as a result we settle for second best. so when it comes to computer security  trusted systems could be a major step forward. after all  if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run. and if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded. at the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems. instead you have to use special software  like hp s protecttools or wave systems  embassy. this provides file encryption  password management and identity protection  usually for business users who connect to company networks. full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from microsoft until the next release of windows   longhorn . this will include what microsoft  in a typical act of obscurantism  calls the  next generation secure computing base   and it will give user-level programs access to the trusted computing hardware. when that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities  and no doubt the windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall. however there is a downside to the increased security from viruses  spyware and data theft that this will provide.  because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management (drm) systems more secure  this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music  movies and books that we have bought from them. we have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences. users of apple s itunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other itunes users  a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection.  but the latest version of itunes limits this capability  just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a cd. another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from real s harmony service on your ipod. apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management. once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law. similarly  users of tivo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows  and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day. this happens because of changes that tivo have made to their software  and the users cannot control it. one wonders whether hardware-based drm will work for those who believe that locking-down digital content is a bad idea  and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away. it will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system: in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked. once it is unlocked then someone  somewhere  will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version. and once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable. the efforts going into drm would be much better spent building efficient distribution services  finding business models that are based on trusting your customers  and offering high quality downloads at fair prices. what we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform. the record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us  most of the time  will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material. they will benefit more by building a market in which i can share songs with my friends  record shows i want to watch later  and burn cds for my kids; a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements. we need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.,0.40232515
1452,tech,spam e-mails tempt net shoppers computer users across the world continue to ignore security warnings about spam e-mails and are being lured into buying goods  a report suggests.  more than a quarter have bought software through spam e-mails and 24% have bought clothes or jewellery. as well as profiting from selling goods or services and driving advertising traffic  organised crime rings can use spam to glean personal information. the business software alliance (bsa) warned that people should  stay alert .  many online consumers don t consider the true motives of spammers   said mike newton  a spokesperson for the bsa which commissioned the survey.   by selling software that appears to be legitimate in genuine looking packaging or through sophisticated websites  spammers are hiding spyware without consumers  knowledge.  once the software is installed on pcs and networks  information that is given over the internet can be obtained and abused.   the results also showed that the proportion of people reading - or admitting to reading - and taking advantage of adult entertainment spam e-mails is low  at one in 10. the research  which covered 6 000 people in six countries and their attitudes towards junk e-mails  revealed that brazilians were the most likely to read spam. a third of them read unsolicited junk e-mail and 66% buy goods or services after receiving spam.  the french were the second most likely to buy something (48%)  with 44% of britons taking advantage of products and services. this was despite 38% of people in all countries being worried about their net security because of the amount of spam they get. more than a third of respondents said they were concerned that spam e-mails contained viruses or programs that attempted to collect personal information.  both industry and the media have helped to raise awareness of the issues that surround illegitimate e-mail  helping to reduce the potential financial damage and nuisance from phishing attacks and spoof websites   said william plante  director of corporate security and fraud protection at security firm symantec.  at the same time  consumers need to continue exercising caution and protect themselves from harm with a mixture of spam filters  spyware detection software and sound judgement.,0.19674492

1909,sport,sculthorpe wants lions captaincy paul sculthorpe has admitted he would love to succeed andy farrell as great britain skipper if the wigan star does switch codes to rugby union.  sculthorpe was vice-captain in the tri-nations  and took the st helens captaincy from chris joynt last year.  i would definitely want the job - i make no bones about it   sculthorpe told bbc sport.  it s something i ve always wanted to do. i d gladly take it if it was offered to me.   the 27-year-old  who captained st helens to challenge cup success last year  said following in the footsteps of farrell would be a challenge.  andy would be a hard act to follow but it s something i m confident of being up to   he said.  the gb team isn t a one-man team. there are a lot of good young players who are pushing for places anyway.   sculthorpe said the rugby league world would understand if farrell did decide to move to rugby union.  it s a short career and you have to make of it what you can   said sculthorpe.  nobody can blame him if he does go - he s done everything in the game of rugby league.   financially it could set him up for life. if he fancies a new challenge  then who could fault him   sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have a serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play. sean long  sculthorpe s saints and lions team-mate  has expressed doubts about his international future  i think sean s situation is to do with the sheer number of games we re playing   he said.   the way he s looking at it is that if he can extend his career by a couple of years by not playing international rugby  then he s willing to do that.  the rfl has got to do something about the fixtures. we re playing 42 weeks of the year and it s too much.  a lot of the niggly injuries that i ve suffered with over the last couple of years have come about because of the lack of rest time.  st helens have been strongly linked with a move for brilliant young forward sonny bill williams  and sculthorpe said he would love the 19-year-old to come to knowsley road.  he s a great player - a big strong lad who can certainly hit hard in defence  but who is also very skilful   he said.  i d love him to come to st helens. who knows what might happen  but you want the best players in your team  and he s certainly one of the best players in the world.,1.469374
1040,politics,cabinet anger at brown cash raid ministers are unhappy about plans to use whitehall cash to keep council tax bills down  local government minister nick raynsford has acknowledged.  gordon brown reallocated £512m from central to local government budgets in his pre-budget report on thursday. mr raynsford said he had held some  pretty frank discussions  with fellow ministers over the plans. but he said local governments had to deliver good services without big council tax rises.  the central government cash is part of a £1bn package to help local authorities in england keep next year s council tax rises below 5%  in what is likely to be a general election year.  mr raynsford said nearly all central government departments had an interest in well run local authorities. and he confirmed rows over the issue with ministerial colleagues.  obviously we had some pretty frank discussions about this   he told bbc radio 4 s the world at one. but he said there was a recognition that  a good settlement for local government  was important to health  education and  other government departments . ministers had to be sure local government could deliver without  unreasonable council tax increases   he added. mr raynsford dismissed a suggestion the move was designed to keep council taxes down ahead of an expected general election.   this is a response to the concerns that have been voiced by local government about the pressures they face.  mr raynsford also plans to make savings of £100m by making changes to local government pensions schemes. these would raise the age from which retiring workers could claim their pensions and limit how much they received if they retired early. he insisted the changes were  very modest  and designed to tackle the problem of workers retiring  very early . but general secretary of the public services union unison dave prentis criticised the plans.  if you want world class public services you don t get that by hitting people as they approach retirement.,1.5923061

1699,sport,record fails to lift lacklustre meet yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record  but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham.  and hey  there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking a world record.  apparently  isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time. athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can  and i would like to see her have a go at 5m in competition. mind you  every time she breaks the record she gets $30 000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it. world records aside  i thought it was a very encouraging evening s work for kelly holmes. she looked good and was very positive. agnes samaria  who came second  is in very good shape and is in the world s top three 800m runners this season. yes  samaria let kelly get away  but there was no coming back over the last 200m as kelly dominated the race  so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly. my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships  but she just hasn t convinced herself she is fit enough to do so. on the other hand  i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men s 60m in madrid. he started well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners. jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish.  it would have been nice to see what mark lewis-francis could have done in the final  if only he hadn t got himself disqualified. he was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage  but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly. my view is you re meant to go when the gun goes and not before. and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again. having said that  mark is looking in much better shape. but i haven t seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests france s ronald pognon - who has run 6.45 seconds - will be under threat at the europeans. from a british point of view  sarah claxton s victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet.  something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the women s national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds. aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the european championships. scotland s lee mcconnell is probably going to run too  so we have a real prospect of a medal. from an international perspective  i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the 3 000m  but i don t think the pace-making was great. canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last year s shape she would have given defar a real run for her money. she had a go but just could not hang in there. we were also expecting a bit more from bernard lagat in the men s 1500m. but he has only just come over from the usa  so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape. as for kenenisa bekele  he was well beaten by markos geneti. but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season. it was very hot in the national indoor arena and i felt uncomfortable in the commentary box. i think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.,0.1748333

409,business,eu aiming to fuel development aid european union finance ministers meet on thursday to discuss proposals  including a tax on jet fuel  to boost development aid for poorer nations.  the policy makers are to ask for a report into how more development money can be raised  the eu said. the world s richest countries have said they want to increase the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015. airlines have reacted strongly against the proposed fuel levy.  profits have been under pressure in the airline industry  with low-cost firms driving down prices and demand dipping after the 11 september terrorist attacks and the outbreak of the killer sars virus.  things have picked up  but some european and us companies are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. at present  the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in eu member states.  of course we applaud humanitarian initiatives  but why target the airlines   said ulrich schulte-strathaus  secretary general of the association of european airlines.  our industry is in the midst of a fundamental crisis...only to be once again confronted with a measure designed to increase our costs   he continued.  the eu sought to allay the airlines  fears  stressing that thursday s meeting was only a first step and that other proposals were also under consideration. it added that any plan to levy taxes on jet fuel  should not hinder the competitiveness of the airlines and that they themselves will not be solely funding development . any tax would only be implemented after full consultation with the airlines  the eu said. there is thought to be widespread support for the plan - tabled by france and germany following the recent g7 meeting of the world s richest nations - from eu ministers. the issue of poverty in africa and south asia has forced itself to the top of the politicial agenda  with politicians and campaigners calling for more to be done. at their meeting in london  g7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world s poorest countries.,0.25508928
202,sport,ferguson fears milan cutting edge manchester united manager sir alex ferguson said his side s task against ac milan would not be made any easier by the absence of andriy shevchenko.  milan s talismanic european footballer of the year misses wednesday s champions league first-leg tie after fracturing his cheekbone.  it s a loss (to milan)  but it could be worse if they didn t have such quality to bring in   ferguson said.  how much they miss him i think they ll know tomorrow night.  ferguson said milan s front line would still represent a formidable challenge for his defenders.  they can play rui costa and play kaka forward. they can bring serginho in and they can play (jon dahl) tomasson   he said. ferguson s own goalscoring talisman ruud van nistelrooy is fit again  but the scot admitted he was unsure whether to start the dutchman  who has not played for three months.   ruud is the best striker in europe. what i have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long   he said.  his ability puts him in with a big shout but it is a major decision.  ferguson  though  is confident his young players  particularly wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo  are up to the task.  we have an opportunity to win this cup this year  no question about that   he declared.  with the maturity we see every week in ronaldo and rooney  the return of van nistelrooy and the form of roy keane  paul scholes and ryan giggs  we must have a fantastic chance.  it is a view shared by rooney  who believes  if we can get past milan  we have a great chance .  as soon as i knew we were playing milan  i got excited. looking at the draw  it is anyone s trophy but we have every chance.  hopefully  we can get to that final in turkey and bring the cup back to manchester.  milan coach carlo ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted europe s most prestigious club title two seasons ago. milan beat juventus in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie at old trafford and ancelotti said:  we are all very happy to return (to old trafford) to play in the champions league and this will give us great motivation.  ancelotti said he was aware of the threat united posed to his hopes of champions league glory.  it s fundamental that we don t allow them to take control of the game. our intention is not to adapt to their play but to play our game   he said.  they have great quality in attack  they use the wings a lot and we will have to make sure we stop them.,1.6608579
31,tech,firefox browser takes on microsoft microsoft s internet explorer has a serious rival in the long-awaited firefox 1.0 web browser  which has just been released.  few people get excited when some new software is released  especially when the program is not a game or a music or movie player. but the release of the first full version of firefox has managed to drum up a respectable amount of pre-launch fervour. fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the new york times announcing that version 1.0 of the browser is available. the release of firefox 1.0 on 9 november might even cause a few heads to turn at microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant s internet explorer browser.  firefox has been created by the mozilla foundation which was started by former browser maker netscape back in 1998. much of the development work done since then has gone into firefox which made its first appearance under this name in february. earlier incarnations  but which had the same core technology  were called phoenix and firebird. since then the software has been gaining praise and converts  not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in microsoft s internet explorer. rivals to ie got a boost in late june when two us computer security organisations warned people to avoid the microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability.  internet monitoring firm websidestory has charted the growing population of people using the firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of ie. before july this year  according to websidestory  internet explorer was used by about 95% of web surfers. that figure had remained static for years. in july the ie using population dropped to 94.7% and by the end of october stood at 92.9%. the mozilla foundation claims that firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10% of the windows- using  net-browsing population. firefox is proving popular because  at the moment  it has far fewer security holes than internet explorer and has some innovations lacking in microsoft s program. for instance  firefox allows the pages of different websites to be arranged as tabs so users can switch easily between them. it blocks pop-ups  has a neat way of finding text on a page and lets you search through the pages you have browsed.  one of the most powerful features of firefox is the many hundreds of extras  or extensions  produced for it. the mozilla foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program. this has resulted in many different add-ons or extensions for the browser which now include everything from a version of the familiar google toolbar to a homeland security monitor that keep users aware of current threat levels. firefox  which used to be called firebird and before that phoenix  also has a growing number of vocal net-based fans. a campaign co-ordinated by the spread firefox website attempted to raise the $50 000 needed for a full page advert in the new york times. the campaign set itself a target of recruiting 2500 volunteers. ten days in to the campaign 10 000 people had signed up and now about $250 000 has been raised. the ad is due to run sometime in a three-week period in late november/early december. the surplus cash will be used to help keep the mozilla foundation running. microsoft is facing a growing challenge to ie s hold on the web using population. from alternative browsers such as opera  safari  amaya and even netscape.,0.522079
532,sport,england s defensive crisis grows england s defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of tottenham s ledley king from the squad to face holland.  chelsea s john terry and wayne bridge are also out  leaving coach sven-goran eriksson with a real problem for wednesday s match at villa park. injured rio ferdinand and sol campbell were both left out of the squad  and matthew upson has already pulled out. wes brown and jamie carragher are likely to be the makeshift partnership. terry  the captain of chelsea as they push for the premiership title  would have been a certain starter in the absence of campbell and ferdinand. but now he has pulled out with a bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by carragher  alongside brown.  manchester united s brown last played for england in the defeat by australia at upton park in february 2003. the 25-year-old was only called into the squad on sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of upson  who has a hamstring injury. and brown now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for england. king was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by england s medical staff. eriksson has still not decided whether to call up any further back-up  having already summoned phil neville after bridge pulled out with a foot injury.,1.5199428
1954,business,weak dollar trims cadbury profits the world s biggest confectionery firm  cadbury schweppes  has reported a modest rise in profits after the weak dollar took a bite out of its results.  underlying pre-tax profits rose 1% to £933m ($1.78bn) in 2004  but would have been 8% higher if currency movements were stripped out. the owner of brands such as dairy milk  dr pepper and snapple generates more than 80% of its sales outside the uk. cadbury said it was confident it would hit its targets for 2005.  while the external commercial environment remains competitive  we are confident that we have the strategy  brands and people to deliver within our goal ranges in 2005   said chief executive todd stitzer.  the modest profit rise had been expected by analysts after the company said in december that the poor summer weather had hit soft drink sales in europe.  cadbury said its underlying sales were up by 4% in 2004. growth was helped by its confectionery brands - including cadbury  trident and halls - which enjoyed a  successful  year  with like-for-like sales up 6%. drinks sales were up 2% with strong growth in us carbonated soft drinks  led by dr pepper and diet drinks  offset by the weaker sales in europe. cadbury added that its fuel for growth cost-cutting programme had saved £75m in 2004  bringing total cost savings to £100m since the scheme began in mid-2003. the programme is set to close 20% of the group s factories and shed 10% of the workforce. cadbury schweppes employs more than 50 000 people worldwide  with about 7 000 in the uk.,1.1040821
1205,politics,housing plans criticised by mps  irreversible environmental damage  will be caused by government plans to build more than one million homes in south-east england  mps have warned.   sustainable communities  were being promoted without a real understanding of what  sustainable  means  the environmental audit committee said. it said issues like energy needs and transport were not properly addressed. deputy prime minister john prescott said the report was completed before new initiatives were announced. he said:  we are working across government  especially with our colleagues at defra  to create cleaner  safer and greener communities  while protecting and enhancing the environment.   the report said there was far too little attention paid to many environmental issues  including water  even though supplies in parts of the south east are already too low. regulations designed to ensure energy-efficient buildings are too lax  and builders routinely flout them anyway  it said.  financing for improving transport was around one-twentieth of what would be required. the report was a stinging rebuke for the government and especially john prescott s department  bbc environment correspondent richard black said. chairman of the environmental audit committee peter ainsworth mp  said:  the government s housing policy is an alarming example of disjointed thinking in an areas where joined-up policy is crucial.  i accept the need to improve housing supply but  as things stand  the principal beneficiary of housing growth will be property developers  with the environment we all depend on being the principal loser.  points raised in the report included:    - no proposals to further increase housing supply should be taken forward without strong supporting evidence.   - the government should recognise shortcomings of the treasury s barker review  which said 140 000 new homes a year were needed in britain.   - the government should consider a  national spatial framework  for england such as those already in place in scotland and wales.   - the office of the deputy prime minister should maximise brown field development and housing densities.   - measures to encourage improved energy efficiency for existing homes should be considered - including reduced stamp duty for homes that achieve set standards and a clear timetable for achieving zero-emissions homes.   - the government should make clear how it intends to measure its success at creating sustainable communities.     conservative local government spokeswoman caroline spelman said:  there is now growing evidence that john prescott s buildings programme is environmentally unsustainable  leaving a concrete scar across the face of rural england.,1.2429605

1230,business,asia quake increases poverty risk nearly two million people across asia could be thrown into poverty because of the indian ocean tsunami  the asian development bank (adb) has said.  in its first overview of the disaster  the adb said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major cities and factories escaped damage. but the blow to many low-income people could be  enormous . the paris club of rich creditor nations on wednesday offered to freeze debts owed by tsunami-hit countries.  the move was aimed at helping south asian governments find budgets to rebuild devastated coastal areas  though so far only sri lanka  indonesia and the seychelles have indicated that they will take it up.  other countries believe their economies are strong enough to cope or wish to avoid being viewed as credit risks.  poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster   said adb chief economist ifzal ali. donor nations have promised to give $717m (£379m) in disaster relief over the next six months  according to the united nations.  mr ali added his voice to those warning that aid pledges must be promptly delivered  saying the number of people at risk of poverty hinged on  concerns over sanitation and health conditions  and other basic needs  being  properly and quickly addressed .  there are 1.9 billion people in asia living on less than $2 a day. the adb fears that 1 million indonesians could join them  while in india just over half a million people - 645 000 - are at risk of falling into poverty. a quarter of a million sri lankans and 23 500 people in the maldives are also facing poverty. in the maldives  where 43% of the population already lives on less than $2 a day  this could rise to half. sri lanka and the maldives are the two countries the adb fears are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami. sri lanka s government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly $3bn. a government task force held meetings to discuss an emergency rebuilding plan with the adb  world bank and japanese aid agencies on wednesday  and promised to publish the plan within 10 days.  indonesia  malaysia  thailand and india have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years  which should cushion them against reconstruction costs. although indonesia s northern province of aceh suffered the worst death toll  the region s oil and natural gas production facilities  have survived intact   the report said. however  it remains too soon to asses the damage to poor people s livelihoods in aceh because it would depend on how much farm land had been flooded by seawater.  this is a profoundly tragic event for the region and for the millions who are suffering. but the economies of the affected countries except sri lanka and the maldives should emerge with minimal damage   the adb report said. some businesses may even gain from the reconstruction efforts  thereby creating jobs. at a meeting in thailand  abd president thadao chino said he was confident of the country s  own capabilities to restore normalcy to the affected areas and meet the rehabilitation requirements . thailand has said it does not wish to opt for a debt repayment freeze  while india has also rejected international aid  saying it can cope on its own resources. debt repayment holidays carry the risk of credit ratings downgrades  making it more expensive to borrow money in future. indonesia  however  is pressing for greater help with its debts than the current freeze would bring. it is one of the world s most indebted countries.,1.9777141

806,business,china keeps tight rein on credit china s efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005  state media report.  the curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. there were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. growth in china remains at a breakneck 9.1%  and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. the breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. rapid tooling-up of china s manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. in theory  the government has a 7% growth target  but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a  hard landing  in the shape of an overbalancing economy. a low exchange rate - china s yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar  which seems to be in relentless decline - means chinese exports are cheap on world markets. china has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. to some extent  the credit controls do seem to be taking effect. industrial output grew 15.7% in the year to october  down from 23% in february  and inflation slowed to 4.3% - although retail sales are still booming.,0.061817646
1498,sport,man city 0-2 man utd manchester united reduced chelsea s premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city.  wayne rooney met gary neville s cross to the near post with a low shot  which went in via a deflection off richard dunne  to put united ahead. seven minutes later  the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james  head and into his own net. steve mcmanaman wasted city s best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. in the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar. and city seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern. only shaun wright-phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony  looking lively down the right and causing gabriel heinze problems.  wes brown also found wright-phillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline. wright-phillips  sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered a pin-point centre to the feet of mcmanaman. but the former liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against united by side-footing the easy chance wide. john o shea was forced off after an earlier clash with sylvain distin and cristiano ronaldo came on to replace him. he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much-needed pace into the united attack. rooney was being well marshalled by dunne - but that was all about to change. after the break  united poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play. and when neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of city s best first-half chance  rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it - even if he needed the help of dunne s leg. worse was to come for dunne  who had been having a fine match. on 75 minutes  he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooney s cross and united seemed home and dry. however  city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range. and united keeper roy carroll saved well from kiki musampa. but united could have a had a third late on when substitute ryan giggs hit the post.  - manchester city boss kevin keegan:  we had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial.  we started off with a good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace a bit too much.  but we still had four good chances  two after we d gone 2-0 down  the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from.    - manchester united boss sir alex ferguson:  it wasn t our best performance of the last three months but i think we re deserved winners.  at times  especially in the first half  we didn t play with enough speed. but with (cristiano) ronaldo and (ryan) giggs on  the speed improved.  derby games can be like that  they can be scrappy  dull  horrible and it was maybe like that.  man city: james  mills (bradley wright-phillips 83)  dunne  distin  thatcher  shaun wright-phillips  barton (macken 68)  sibierski  mcmanaman  musampa  fowler. subs not used: weaver  onuoha  flood. booked: fowler  sibierski. man utd: carroll  gary neville  ferdinand  brown  heinze  o shea (ronaldo 33)  keane  fortune  fletcher (giggs 64)  rooney  scholes (phil neville 84). subs not used: howard  bellion. booked: rooney  scholes  keane. goals: rooney 68  dunne 75 og. att: 47 111 ref: s bennett (kent).,1.4118791

1113,tech,satellite mapping aids darfur relief aid workers trying to house  feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the sudanese region of darfur are getting a helping hand from advanced mapping technology.  a european consortium of companies and university groups known as respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps. the aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed. respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly.  respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks  for the rivers and for the villages  to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes   said einar bjorgo from unosat  the un satellite mapping organisation that is part of the respond consortium.  the group uses satellites from nasa  the european space agency and the disaster monitoring constellation. the satellite data is transmitted to ground stations. from there  the information makes its way to respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data.  you have to convert the data into images  then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis  damage  or situation maps   said stefan voigt  who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations  the german aerospace centre.  this kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but respond gets it done in about 12 hours.  our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery  reading satellite maps  so it s our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very  very efficiently   said mr voigt. respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web  and on compact disc. but the best map is one you can hold in your hands  especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce.  a map is a working document   explains herbert hansen of respond s belgian partner keyobs.  you need to use it  you need to write on it  correct  give feedback and so on  so you need paper to write on.  we print maps  we laminate the maps  we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map  it s completely protected.   humanitarian groups in darfur have been making good use of respond s maps. they have come in especially handy during sudan s rainy season  when normally dry riverbeds  or wadis  became flooded.  these wadis had a very small amount of flooding  generally  in terms of depth  but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground   says stephen candillon of respond imaging partner sertit. respond s rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis  allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times. aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it.  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production,-1.2338791

759,business,gm pays $2bn to evade fiat buyout general motors of the us is to pay fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; £1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the italian car maker outright.  fiat had sold gm a stake in 2000  as part of a partnership agreement. but fiat s heavy losses have convinced gm - whose own european operations are in the red - to back away. the pay-off means the two firms will unwind joint ventures  but fiat will keep supplying diesel engines and the money will allow it to reduce its debt. fiat s shares on the milan stock exchange rose 4.5% by 0900 gmt to 6.2 euros  having shot up more than 7% in early trading.  we now have absolute freedom to design our own future   said fiat chief executive sergio marchionne.  analysts said fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal  although some predictions had expected a 2bn euro pay-off. fiat is to get 1bn euros immediately  with another 550m to follow within 90 days. the firm is italy s largest private employer  and a failure to reach an agreement could have had severe consequences for thousands of workers and for the italian economy. for its part  gm was keen to ward off any criticism that the deal had been a mistake.   we needed scale in europe to get costs down  and we were able to do that in working with fiat   said gm chief executive rick wagoner.  the fiat-gm alliance came about in 2000 as an alternative to selling fiat outright. german-us car firm daimlerchrysler had been willing to buy the firm  but fiat patriarch gianni agnelli did not want to give up control. instead  gm swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of fiat - and gave fiat a  put option  to sell gm the rest of the car maker between january 2004 and july 2009. but despite the alliance fiat failed to put itself back on track  continuing to lose money and market share. as a result  the sell-off looked better and better for the italians - and much worse for gm  which is struggling with its own loss-making european marques opel and saab. the relationship soured further after fiat sold half its finance arm and recapitalised in 2003  halving gm s stake to 10%.,2.41368
598,politics,teenagers to be allowed to be mps teenagers will be able to become mps under plans unveiled by ministers.  in a written statement  constitutional affairs minister christopher leslie said the current minimum age of 21 for an mp would be reduced to 18. the proposals follow a recommendation last year by elections watchdog the electoral commission.  the government intends to legislate  when parliamentary time allows  to lower the age   said mr leslie  who was elected in 1997 at the age of 24. even if the move does go ahead it is unlikely it will be in place before the next general election  widely predicted for may.  the announcement from mr leslie - who was elected in 1997 in a formerly safe tory seat - prompted calls for a lowering of the voting age to 16. the votes at 16 alliance said it was a good thing to  engage people  by lowering the candidacy age but argued lowering the voting age would be much more effective.  candidacy affects only politicians. the voting age affects millions of younger people   said spokesman alex folkes.  we would hope that the government will table a bill that is broad enough to allow for amendments to be brought to test support for a reduction in the voting age.   currently candidates in both local and national votes must be 21 while the voting age is 18. that is because the age of majority was reduced to 18 in 1969 but laws dating from 1695 which determine the current voting age stayed in place. irish republican bernadette devlin was one of just a handful of 21-year-olds elected to parliament in the 20th century winning a seat in 1969. but the youngest is understood to have been tory edward turnour  who won the 1904 horsham by-election aged 21 and 144 days and served in parliament for 47 continuous years. last april s report by the electoral commission said there was no strong argument for leaving the age for standing for election at 21. the commission found the most common approach around the world is for the voting age to be the same as the candidacy age.,2.1230867
602,business,pension hitch for long-living men male life expectancy is much higher than originally estimated  leading pension researchers have said.  the pensions policy institute (ppi) said life expectancy for unskilled and professional men has been understated. life expectancy at birth is 71 years for a manual worker and 79 years for a professional - a gap of eight years. but if measured at age 65 instead  the ppi said  a manual worker will live to 81 years and a professional worker to 86 years - a gap of just five years. the ppi s estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach 65 years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy.  the government has ruled out raising the state pension age  because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies. chris curry  ppi research director  said its calculations suggested there could be more pressure on state pension spending than originally envisaged.  even people in social class v [unskilled manual workers] who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live 16 years after state pension age   he said. researchers have not updated life expectancy projections for women  who on average live longer than men.,-0.8579502
2217,tech,rings of steel combat net attacks gambling is hugely popular  especially with tech-savvy criminals.  many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid. but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk s biggest net firms to stop these attacks. increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures.  net firms are realising that it s not just about anti-virus and firewalls   said paul king  chief security architect at cisco.  there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres.  mr king said the only way to properly combat these so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems. many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres  so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting  said mr king. this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale.  malcolm seagrave  security expert at energis  said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time. bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen  he said.  it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing   he said.  so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data  said mr seagrave. however  he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted. maria capella  spokeswoman for net provider pipex  said that when ddos attacks were at their height  customers were getting hit every four to five days. the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites.  it s about understanding what s genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site   she said.  we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that s when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack   said ms capella. this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries  each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.  typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus. hijacked computers are known as zombies or  bots and collections of them are called  bot nets. many spammers rent out  bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail.  most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult. often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen.  the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail   said ms capella.  we ask  as part of the service we provide  that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning.  once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up. energis took a similar approach  said mr seagrave.  we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together   said mr seagrave. also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from. information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests. he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target.  we have people in places where they shouldn t be  monitoring tech sites   he said. sometimes though  he said  spotting the next victim was easy.  you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites  trying one after another   said mr seagrave.,0.4647751
1733,sport,borders 19-20 ulster ulster clung on for a morale-boosting celtic league win over bottom club borders at netherdale on friday night.  a late try by borders substitute jonny weston had set up a dramatic finish  but the scottish side could not complete the fightback. ulster had led 20-6 with tries from paul steinmetz and bryn cunningham. but the irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by charlie hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. calum macrae surrendered possession before centre steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. substitute joe pattison - who had come on for the injured gareth morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.  the speedy steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time  giving adam larkin an easy conversion. ally warnock clawed back three points for borders  but they were soon hit by another double-blow. first  mark blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper andy ward. larkin again added the extras. even worse was to come for borders when larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break  the second of which also led to kelly brown being sin-binned. the hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart  however  when warnock struck a penalty at the other end. and he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. ulster coach mark mccall said he was delighted to get the victory.  borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time   said mccall.  in the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.   morton  moffat  macrae  hore  berthinussen  warnock  moore  thomson  ford  douglas  blair  stewart  gray  brown  mcentee.  kay  parr  mcgee  rennick  weston  millar  pattison.  cunningham  maxwell  bell  steinmetz  howe  larkin  campbell  s. best  shields  moore  frost  mccullough  ward  feather  n. best.  brady  mccormick  longwell  browne  doak  s. young  bowe.  phil fear (wru),-1.221982

811,business,bp surges ahead on high oil price oil giant bp has announced a 26% rise in annual profits to $16.2bn (£8.7bn) on the back of record oil prices.  last week  rival shell reported an annual profit of $17.5bn - a record profit for a uk-listed company. bp added that it was increasing its fourth-quarter dividend by 26% to 8.5 cents  and that it would continue with share buybacks. bp chief executive lord browne said the results were strong  both operationally and financially.   the company is earning about $1.8m an hour.  despite the record annual profits figure  bp s performance was below the expectations of some city analysts. however  bp s share price rose 4p or nearly 1% in morning trading to 548p. its profit rise for the year included profits of $3.65bn (£1.97bn) for the final three months of 2004 - up from $2.89bn a year ago but below its third quarter.  speaking on the bbc s today programme on tuesday  lord browne said the profits were not solely down to the high oil price alone.   the profits are up more than the price of oil is up   he said. lord browne pointed out that bp was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration.  we have spent many years buying (assets) when the price is low   he said. the company has made new discoveries in egypt  the gulf of mexico and angola.  however  lord browne rejected calls for a windfall tax on his company s huge profits  saying that in the north sea it paid progressively more tax  the more profits it made. lord browne believes oil prices will remain quite high. currently above $40 a barrel  he said:  the price of oil will be well supported above $30 a barrel for the medium term.  bp put production for the year at 3.997 billion barrels of oil  up 10% on 2003  but slightly lower than the four billion barrels it had initially aimed for.,0.658823

865,entertainment,brits debate over  urban  music joss stone  a 17-year-old soul singer from devon  beat dizzee rascal  jamelia  lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards. her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is.      i m not really comfortable with the word urban. it s a word that s been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music. the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it s wrong. how far are the brits removed from inner-city music and what people are doing  it s so far removed that i don t expect them to get it bang on. the music industry isn t championing music from our particular genre very well anyway. people don t feel like that s anything to do with us. i don t feel like urban music s just been celebrated by [joss stone] winning or her being nominated  or by the brits acknowledging that there s an urban music scene because it s all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day. it s not really relevant. if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who she s signed to  then so be it. it s got nothing to do with what s really going on.    urban as a genre is very broad. if you look underneath urban  there are a number of core elements that include hip-hop  r&b  garage and into that obviously comes soul. joss stone is a soul artist. her first album was called the soul sessions. so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub-genres  and there are offshoots of all of those. joss stone has had amazing success [in the us] given that she s a uk artist. what has really captured everybody s imagination is that here you have a 17-year-old from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really  really good tunes and she looks good - i think that s what s done it.  the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base.    i don t think joss was not a worthy winner. she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban. the fact that she s from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and she s literally rural. the great thing about urban music is that there s a big range. if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain  i think that s where you can call it urban - that s where this new sub-category  or uber-category  has come from. joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer  but you couldn t argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions - it is coming from somewhere genuine. it has to come across as real. that s the only cut-off point we have here and that s the only way by which we judge people.    what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background. music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi-cultural britain  then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion. if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community  i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too. race doesn t make a difference if everyone is included. out of all the awards dished out yesterday  i m still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award.    a type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city  and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life.  she might not be urban  but when did r&b become the hip hop tainted thing it is now  r&b stands for rhythm and blues  remember!  that joss stone is rubbish is certain. if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (i think probably should include hip-hop  soul & funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the streets  although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim  she definitely deserved to win a prize  joss stone s albums are quite simply amazing  easily better than anything else that was released last year. this whole debate about what is urban  what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who weren t nominated or didn t win. i cant see why people can t just congratulate her for the talent that she is.  she did deserve it  but i agree with the comments about urban music. its a stupid phrase  and particularly british. in the states they tend to use hip hop and r&b  if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what i m talking about. very strange.  what s in a name  a rose by any other name etc... if people want to call it urban  why not  if we really analysed it  the term  dance music  is misleading because it doesn t describe everything you can dance to.  whilst i agree that the term  urban  is open to interpretation  it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won.  urban  to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities - i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties i ve been to. good luck to joss stone  let s celebrate her victory - let s also question why  with artists so successful and talented as jamelia  lemar  kanye west  dizzee rascal  alicia keys and outkast - we didn t see a single black artist on stage collecting an award.  so  what you re saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isn t black. and  if it is  then they shouldn t be acknowledged for it even if they re pretty dam good at it  she s 17  has an amazing voice  and won. good on her. oh  but she s not  black  well  let s make her feel real bad about it then. how dare she! though hang on  didn t the so-called  public  vote on this one   this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what  jazz  was. the media then called anything that had a swinging beat  syncopated melody or soulful feeling  jazz   much to the chagrin of the artists. it would mean that  blues  would be put in the same mould as  bebop    cool  and  ragtime   all very different styles at that time. jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term. and so what of  urban  music  in truth it s a lazy term to categorise music that you don t really understand. soul and garage are worlds apart musically (marvin gaye v tuff jam )  but no doubt have their connections. if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won  then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is  rather than what it represents.  i demand a prize for rural music! sucks to the cities- it s way better out here. we have hay  for one thing.  excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely  i dont understand the point that ty is making. if lemar  who makes music which is less soulful than joss  work won  he might have said nothing. (btw i m black too)  how can she be  urban  if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside  nonsense.  i love joss to bits and don t care what her branding is - it s amazing music  full stop. stop puting it all in brackets and let s just call it music  and let s especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin  this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.  surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is (historically) considered urban music  irrelevent of the colour of their skin  or where they originate from. joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style  just as someone from an inner city  and indeed not from the usa could sing country music. if that person was good at it and authentic in sound  would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style   the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed  in part  from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards. the very term  music of black origin  has confused and offended many people. this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards. it appears that the use of  black  or  white  in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable. the term  urban  therefore  has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first  black  or  white  thereby rendering the issue colourblind. the result is now a redundant new debate as to what  urban  also means. perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul/rnb and hip-hop  one which does not also mean something else - as we have done with  crunk .  urban is just a word that s come about recently to describe  black  music that s become popular now. the word wasn t even in use  or common use five of six years ago. it s just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music  because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it.  i m in a band that has been called  urban   and i despise the label. i d hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche  because that s all it is. ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider  music of black origin   these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity. look at all the tv broadcasters  unable to reach young people without condesending  they simply play some  urban  music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music. ignore the labels  it is what it is  just music.  as a black man  i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives. black people should lead the music they invented . we should stop calling a genre meaningless  northing is meaningless. the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black  same thing  with streets  amy winehouse  etc. who s ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson.. they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos   but why not brits      so what if joss stone won the urban awards. her music is great soul and surely that is under the  urban  banner  what if the streets had won  would people be whining because mike skinner is white... it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else.  urban is pc version for saying black music. i m not doubting ms stone s talent  but why didn t jamelia or lemar get a brit  this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past  getting nominations are easy to get  but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing.  refreshing to see people making reasonable  intelligent comments on any topic these days. more power to you  people! you have said it: there is music you like and music you don t like - who cares what label you put on it   that entire category was a mess. how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone  its like putting eminem against bob geldof. she should have been nominated for best british r & b act. joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents  but i don t think it was very  urban  of her to sing angels with robbie williams.  urban is a nonsense term - music of black origin  well doesn t that include rock  music made in the inner cities  well almost all bands end up making music in london/manchester etc. and doesn t that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities  it doesn t make any sense.  why does music have to be put into a genre  it s music  you like it or you don t. simple as that.  i play in a heavy metal band. we are urban music as far as i m concerned. we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment; it therefore directly shapes what we write musically.   urban  seems to be the new name for all styles of black music. why it needed a rebrand i don t know as the name is misleading. oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know  therefore more than fit the term  urban  yet as they re a white rock band they won t be described as such.  joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery - what other reason do they need to award her the brit  all this  urban  and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored.  yeah  she deserved it. she is talented. urban is a crap  meaningless  politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though. there s only two kinds of music: good and bad.,-2.6769786

1763,sport,mourinho to escape fa charge chelsea boss jose mourinho will not face any football association action over the comments he made after their carling cup tie with manchester united.  mourinho intimated that united boss sir alex ferguson influenced referee neale barry after the duo walked down the tunnel together at half-time. but an fa spokesman told bbc sport:  we are not taking action over mourinho.  we have looked at the comments and we have decided that no further action is required. that is the end of it.  mourinho was concerned that ferguson s conversation with barry was followed by an inconsistent display by the official.  i see one referee in the first half and another in the second   said mourinho.  if the fa ask me what happened  i will tell them. what i saw and felt made it easier to understand a few things.   maybe when i turn 60 and have been managing in the same league for 20 years and have the respect of everybody i will have the power to speak to people and make them tremble a little bit.  the referee controlled the game in one way during the first half but in the second they had dozens of free-kicks. it was fault after fault  dive after dive.  but i know the referee did not walk to the dressing rooms alone at half-time. he should only have had his two assistants and the fourth official with him  but there was also someone else.  referees chief keith hackett believes mourinho should retract his comments about ferguson and barry as he believes the blues boss has questioned their integrity.  i m hoping he might reconsider his comments  unfortunately this is the nature of the game   said hackett.  i don t want referees or myself getting in the psychological warfare between two managers. for the second leg we have an experienced referee  and we should be talking about the quality of that game rather than the refereeing.  sometimes managers have grounds for comments  and i note that  but a referees integrity has been questioned  that is offensive and should be avoided. mr mourinho should look at the facts.  mourinho added that the match was entertaining for a goalless draw and insisted his team could still reach the final.  it s 0-0  so if we win we go through and if we get a draw we go to extra time   he said.  we have exactly the same chance we had before this game.  we are confident of getting a result but we know what manchester united is  a footballing power. it ll be difficult for us  but also for them.,2.007885

2209,sport,time to get tough on friendlies  for an international manager  a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players.  the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce. some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week  and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.  i would say it s 50-50 whether you should have these games or not  and if you look at it that way you would probably say you re better not doing so. it would certainly keep club managers happy  as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. the more you play together  the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter-finals against brazil. often in friendlies  though  a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. and it s very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes  let alone a whole team s worth. the debate will rage on  and i m not sure there is a satisfactory solution. one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith. the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts. it is the sort of move you would expect from walter  who is a canny manager.  the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers. if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten  it would have done them no good whatsoever. john toshack has his first game in charge of wales  and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary. he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance  but the public wants results. it s extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies. if you win  people forget them  but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you. england s game against holland is a good example. it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson. but you have got to remember sven-goran eriksson s side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played.  the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress. for the club managers  it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed.,-1.2924471
616,business,uk interest rates held at 4.75% the bank of england has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%  in a widely-predicted move.  rates went up five times from november 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since august. recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending  as well as in mortgage approvals. and retail sales disappointed over christmas  with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.  rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers  optimism  causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods  according to a report earlier this week from the british retail consortium. the brc said britain s retailers had endured their worst christmas in a decade.   today s no change decision is correct   said david frost  director general of the british chambers of commerce (bcc).  but  if there are clear signs that the economy slows  the mpc should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates.  dismal reports from the retail trade about christmas sales are worrying  if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.   mr frost added:  the housing market outlook remains highly uncertain.  it is widely accepted that  if house prices start falling more sharply  the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.  cbi chief economist ian mccafferty said the economy had  slowed in recent months in response to rate rises  but that it was difficult to gauge from the christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer.  the bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures  driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices  against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity   he said.  interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.   on thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front  as the office for national (ons) statistics revealed british manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in november - for the fifth month in the past six. the ons said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in november  matching a similar unrevised fall in october and confounding economists  expectations of a 0.3% rise. manufacturers  organisation  the eef  said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. it also said there was evidence that manufacturers  confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.   so far the evidence suggests that last year s rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing   said eef chief economist  steve radley.  however  should the business outlook start to deteriorate  the bank should stand ready to cut rates.  some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year  although others feel the bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. the bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.,2.3582044
1855,politics,nuclear strike  key terror risk  the uk and us must realise they cannot prevent all terror attacks and should focus on making sure they are not nuclear strikes  says a top academic.  amitai etzioni  a key influence on new labour thinking  says the us emphasis on an  axis of evil  is misplaced. the priority should instead be on  failing states   including russia and pakistan  who cannot properly control their nuclear material  he argues. his report demands a major overhaul of world rules on nuclear technology.  professor etzioni was a senior adviser to president carter s white house and is the guru behind communitarian ideas which influenced the development of blairite third way politics. in a report for the foreign policy centre think tank  he says a nuclear terrorist attack is the main danger faced by many nations.   attempts to defend against it by hardening domestic targets cannot work  nor can one rely on pre-emption by taking the war to the terrorists before they attack   he says. that means there is an urgent need to curb terrorists  access to nuclear arms and the materials used to make them.  we must recognise that we will be unable to stop all attacks and thus ensure terrorists will not be able to strike with weapons of mass destruction   prof etzioni continues.  he suggests so-called rogue states such as iran and north korea are less of a problem than  failed and failing states   which are more likely to be a source of nuclear materials. he names russia as the  failing state  of gravest concern as it has an estimated 90% of all fissile material outside america. and he is also worried about pakistan after one of its top nuclear scientists  abdul qadeer khan  admitted leaking nuclear secrets. prof etzioni criticises the us for overlooking those reports  suggesting it was done in return for pakistani help in hunting osama bin laden.  this is like letting a serial killer go because he promised to catch some jay-walkers   he says.    - upgrading security at nuclear arms stores as a temporary measure   - creating a new global safety authority to tackle nuclear terrorism  using the intelligence links established in the wake of 11 september - backed by the united nations  authority   - encouraging  pressuring and using  all available means  to persuade countries to switch their highly-enriched uranium for less dangerous less-enriched uranium   - when possible  taking fissile material away from failing states to safe havens where it can be blended down or converted   - compelling  failing and rogue states   and eventually all states  to destroy their nuclear bombs.,-1.7586718
1366,tech,broadband in the uk growing fast high-speed net connections in the uk are proving more popular than ever.  bt reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. the 600 000 connections take the total number of people in the uk signing up for broadband from bt to almost 3.3 million. nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of europe.  according to figures gathered by industry watchdog  ofcom  the growth means that the uk has now surpassed germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. the uk total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people  compared to 6.7 in germany and 15.8 in the netherlands. the numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from bt or via the many companies that re-sell bt lines under their own name. part of the surge in people signing up was due to bt stretching the reach of adsl - the uk s most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km.  asymmetric digital subscriber line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. the standard speed is 512kbps  though faster connections are available.  this breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas   said paul reynolds  chief executive of bt wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. bt retail  which sells net services under its own name  also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers. this was a slight increase on the previous three months. despite the good news about growth in broadband  figures from telecommunications regulator ofcom show that bt faces increasing competition  and dwindling influence  in other sectors. local loop unbundling  (llu)  in which bt rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer s home or office  is growing steadily. cable & wireless and ntl have announced that they are investing millions to start offering llu services. by the end of september more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called carrier pre-section (cps) services  such as talktalk and one.tel  which route phone calls across non-bt networks from a local exchange. there are now more than 300 different firms offering cps services and the percentage of people using bt lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%.,-0.74233055

1008,sport,corry backs skipper robinson england forward martin corry says jason robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways.  after losses to wales and france  critics have started to wonder whether robinson can captain from full-back. but corry has backed robinson  who was given the role after the injury to fly-half jonny wilkinson  ahead of this weekend s trip to ireland.  jason is doing a tremendous job. every week my respect for him goes up   corry told bbc radio five live.  he is an inspirational captain. when he talks with the squad he talks with a lot of sense.  the players have a lot of respect for him. it s an honour to be in the england side and an honour to play under him.   england are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their six nations campaign. but corry insists england are in the right frame of mind for the contest.  there is apprehension going into every game   he added.  but you have to use that fear and put it into a positive mindset.  when the whistle goes on sunday  what has happened in the past does not count for anything.   we have not performed but if we put in a performance on sunday then we can start turning results around.  there are a lot of changes taking place with england and we are at the start of something. we have not got off to the greatest of starts but you need to experience the bad the before you can fully appreciate the good.   a trip to lansdowne road is daunting at any time  especially against an ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins. they are the form team of the tournament and are tipped to claim their first grand slam since 1948. but corry is relishing the prospect of taking on the irish in their own backyard.  they are full of confidence and are playing a great team game   he said.  the forwards are creating a great platform and they have explosive runners out wide.  if you look at the team on paper  they have stars from one to 15. it s a huge task but it is a great opportunity for us.  lansdowne road is a tremendous venue to play in and we have to use it to our advantage.,1.2434196
1766,tech,china  to overtake us net use  the chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the us in less than three years  says a report.  china s net users number 100m but this represents less than 8% of the country s 1.3 billion people. market analysts panlogic predicts that net users in china will exceed the 137 million us users of the net by 2008. the report says that the country s culture will mean that chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations.  already net use in china has a very different character than in many western nations  said william makower  chief executive of panlogic. in many western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work. by contrast in china workplace machines are relatively rare. this  combined with the relatively high cost of pcs in china and the time it takes to get phone lines installed  helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in china. only 36% of chinese homes have telephones according to reports.  net usage tends to happen in the evening   said mr makower   they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf&#233;.   its fundamentally different usage to what we have here   he said.  net use in china was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country s eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities. the net is key to helping chinese people keep in touch with friends  said mr makower. many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes. what people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of chinese life. for instance  said mr makower  credit cards are rare in china partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt.  the most popular way to pay is cash-on-delivery   he said   and that s quite a brake to the development of e-commerce.  the arrival of foreign banks in china  due in 2006  could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare  said mr makower. but if chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on western ways of living.  a large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar   he said.  generally it s more difficult for the government to be able to control it.   its real value is as an open window onto what s happening elsewhere in the world   he said. government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages chinese people would not see anywhere else. familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet.  it s a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it   said mr makower.,-1.6650286
466,sport,healey targets england comeback leicester wing austin healey hopes to use sunday s return heineken cup clash with wasps as a further springboard to an england recall for the six nations.  healey  who won 51 caps prior to the 2003 world cup  has been in good form in the tigers  resurgence this season.  i definitely still have ambitions to play for england   healey told the bbc.  we will have to see what happens after the previous (autumn) tests but when i look at the current squad i definitely feel there is a place there for me.  healey  who has also played both half-back positions and full-back during his career  has reverted to the wing  where he won most of his england caps. after recovering from a trapped nerve in his back sustained at the end of september  the 31-year-old is relishing his role in the tigers revival.  i had six weeks out but fortunately i have resumed the sort of form i had before   he said.   i am basically playing where it best suits leicester. obviously i can play scrum-half  fly-half or full-back at a moment s notice.  but playing on the wing actually gives me a bigger free role to come in where i am not expected and influence things.  that has been apparent in parts one and two of the wasps-leicester trilogy in recent weeks. first  healey came off his flank with an angled run to score an injury-time try that earned the tigers a 17-17 draw in their premiership meeting on 21 november. then  in the first of their heineken cup double header last sunday  healey slotted in at stand-off and delivered a superb cross-kick for martin corry to score the tigers  third try.  i caught  cozza s  eye a couple of phases before that and was hoping to get it to him on the full  but fortunately even with the bounce he managed to score   healey recalled.  healey  twice a heineken cup winner  believes last sunday s match was  up there  with some of the biggest club contests he has played in.  it was a very intense occasion and a very destructive game   he recalled.  there was not a huge amount of rugby played but it was a great game to be involved in.  after about 15 minutes i thought we might stride away with it but wasps really came back into it and in the last couple of minutes it could have gone either way.   the same outcome this sunday would put leicester in pole position to top their heineken pool with a home game against biarritz and away trip to calvisano to come. but healey insists the tigers must summon the same desire if they are to deliver the knockout blow in what has been dubbed  rugby s version of rocky ii .  there was a lot of satisfaction in the dressing room aftewards but it is really only a case of a job half done   he added.  it was the first of a two-leg trip and if we lose at welford road it will negate all the positives we can take from result.  i think it came down to who wanted it more and in the end i think we did. we have got to show the same desire again this week.,1.4878716
918,tech,intel unveils laser breakthrough intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light.  scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade.   we ve overcome a fundamental limit   said dr mario paniccia  director of intel s photonics technology lab. writing in the journal nature  dr paniccia - and colleagues haisheng rong  richard jones  ansheng liu  oded cohen  dani hak and alexander fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. currently  says dr paniccia  telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials  such as gallium arsenide  used to make it.  telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved.  we re trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas   said dr paniccia. while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around  before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it  some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material.  it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light   he said. but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. even better  the laser light produced in this way can  with the help of easy-to-make filters  be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses.  it s a technical validation that it can work   he said.,0.45749903

801,sport,ireland 19-13 england ireland consigned england to their third straight six nations defeat with a stirring victory at lansdowne road.  a second-half try from captain brian o driscoll and 14 points from ronan o gara kept ireland on track for their first grand slam since 1948. england scored first through martin corry but had  tries  from mark cueto and josh lewsey disallowed. andy robinson s men have now lost nine of their last 14 matches since the 2003 world cup final. the defeat also heralded england s worst run in the championship since 1987. ireland last won the title  then the five nations  in 1985  but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with wales. and eddie o sullivan s side banished the ghosts of 2003 when england were rampant 42-6 victors in claiming the grand slam at lansdowne road. in front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in dublin  ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when o gara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal.  england took their time to settle but their first real venture into ireland s half produced a simple score for corry. the number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the irish line  racing 25 yards to touch down. england fly-half charlie hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left  but almost immediately o gara  winning his 50th cap  answered with two penalties in quick succession. england were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes  and hodgson  the villain at twickenham  coolly bisected the posts. the first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking  but it was ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs. a series of probes led by the talismanic o driscoll  back from hamstring injury  resulted in a penalty but ireland chose to kick for touch.  from the line-out  the ball was recycled back to o gara  who stroked his second drop-goal  this time off the right upright. as the interval approached  wing josh lewsey was the catalyst for england s most promising attack. the wasps star raced up his touchline and hodgson s cross-kick put in mark cueto for an apparent score  but the sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker. england began the second half well and had ireland pinned in their own half. but another english indiscretion on a rare irish break-out awarded o gara a kick at goal  which he missed. england s pressure continued  and a wave of attacks saw centre jamie noon dragged down yards from the line before hodgson landed a drop-goal.  the lead was shortlived  however. ireland raced upfield  deft handling from the backs  including a clever dummy from geordan murphy on hodgson  ending with o driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts. o gara missed a penalty which would have put ireland nine points clear  and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when hodgson s cross-kick was fumbled by lock ben kay near the line. anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high  but o gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt. inside the last 10 minutes  england poured forward  spurred on by scrum-half matt dawson  who replaced leicester s harry ellis. but despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the tv replay by referee jonathan kaplan - england were unable to pull off a face-saving win. ireland next face france at lansdowne road in two weeks  time before the potential title decider against wales in cardiff. england are still to meet italy at twickenham  in what is now a wooden spoon decider  and scotland.  g murphy; g dempsey  b o driscoll  s horgan  d hickie; r o gara  p stringer; r corrigan  s byrne  j hayes; m o kelly  p o connell; s easterby  j o connor  a foley.  f sheahan  m horan  d o callaghan  e miller  g easterby  d humphreys  k maggs.  j robinson (capt); m cueto  j noon  o barkley  j lewsey; c hodgson  h ellis; g rowntree  s thompson  m stevens; d grewcock  b kay; j worsley  l moody  m corry.  a titterrell  d bell  s borthwick  a hazell  m dawson  a goode  o smith.,1.8547251
1096,tech,internet boom for gift shopping cyberspace is becoming a very popular destination for christmas shoppers.  forecasts predict that british people will spend £4bn buying gifts online during the festive season  an increase of 64% on 2003. surveys also show that the average amount that people are spending is rising  as is the range of goods that they are happy to buy online. savvy shoppers are also using the net to find the hot presents that are all but sold out in high street stores.  almost half of the uk population now shop online according to figures collected by the interactive media in retail group which represents web retailers. about 85% of this group  18m people  expect to do a lot of their christmas gift buying online this year  reports the industry group. on average each shopper will spend £220 and britons lead europe in their affection for online shopping.  almost a third of all the money spent online this christmas will come out of british wallets and purses compared to 29% from german shoppers and only 4% from italian gift buyers. james roper  director of the imrg  said shoppers were now much happier to buy so-called big ticket items such as lcd television sets and digital cameras. mr roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for christmas. he advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular. a survey by hostway suggests that many men prefer to shop online to avoid the embarrassment of buying some types of presents  such as lingerie  for wives and girlfriends. much of this online shopping is likely to be done during work time  according to research carried out by security firm saint bernard software. the research reveals that up to two working days will be lost by staff who do their shopping via their work computer. worst offenders will be those in the 18-35 age bracket  suggests the research  who will spend up to five hours per week in december browsing and buying at online shops.  iggy fanlo  chief revenue officer at shopping.com  said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping.  when you consider narrowband and broadband the conversion to sale is two times higher   he said. higher speeds meant that everything happened much faster  he said  which let people spend time browsing and finding out about products before they buy.  the behaviour of online shoppers was also changing  he said.  the single biggest reason people went online before this year was price   he said.  the number one reason now is convenience.   very few consumers click on the lowest price   he said.  they are looking for good prices and merchant reliability.  consumer comments and reviews were also proving popular with shoppers keen to find out who had the most reliable customer service. data collected by ebay suggests that some smart shoppers are getting round the shortages of hot presents by buying them direct through the auction site. according to ebay uk there are now more than 150 robosapiens remote control robots for sale via the site. the robosapiens toy is almost impossible to find in online and offline stores. similarly many shoppers are turning to ebay to help them get hold of the hard-to-find slimline playstation 2  which many retailers are only selling as part of an expensive bundle. the high demand for the playstation 2 has meant that prices for it are being driven up. in shops the ps2 is supposed to sell for £104.99. in some ebay uk auctions the price has risen to more than double this figure. many people are also using ebay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country. the portable version of the playstation has only just gone on sale in japan yet some enterprising ebay users are selling the device to uk gadget fans.,-1.0932493

1155,politics,bid to cut court witness stress new targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in england and wales have been announced by the lord chancellor.  lord falconer wants all crown courts and 90% of magistrates  courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years. more video links will also be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms. it is part of a five-year plan to help build confidence in the justice system.  ministers say the strategy is aimed at re-balancing the court system towards victims  and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice. launching the department for constitutional affairs  plan  lord falconer said:  one of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims.  the needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed.   courts  judges  magistrates  prosecutors  police and victim support - all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first  without compromising the rights of the defendant.  he went on:  giving evidence is a nerve-wracking experience  especially when you re a victim.  yet with a will and with support it can be done.  lord falconer told bbc radio 4 s today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence. other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts.  you are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence   he said.  but you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem  it s not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them.   the plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925  as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses. another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform  with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the house of lords on tuesday. ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor  but the lords have over-ruled this. lord falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from parliament. the person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the house of lords  he said  and should be the best person chosen from either house of parliament. what they did  not what they were called  was the critical issue  he added.,1.6791382

863,tech,online commons to spark debate online communities set up by the uk government could encourage public debate and build trust  says the institute of public policy research (ippr).  existing services such as ebay could provide a good blueprint for such services  says the think-tank. although the net is becoming part of local and central government  its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online  commons  for public debate. in its report  is online community a policy tool   the ippr also asks if id cards could help create safer online communities. adopting an ebay-type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection.  what we are proposing is a civic commons   will davies  senior research fellow at the ippr told the bbc news website.  a single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication - like a pre-legislation discussion.   the idea of a  civic commons  was originally proposed by stephen coleman  professor of e-democracy at the oxford internet institute. the ippr report points to informal  small scale examples of such commons that already exist. it mentions good-practice public initiatives like the bbc s ican project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues.  but he adds  government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too. proposals for id cards  for instance  could also be widened to see if they could be used online. they could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer-to-peer interaction online.  at the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services   said mr davies.  but what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities.  the key idea to take from systems such as ebay and other online communities is letting members rate each other s reputation by how they treat other members. using a similar mechanism  trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built. this could mean a civic commons would work within a non-market system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publicly-recognised rules.  e-government initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web. many online communities  such as chatrooms  mailing lists  community portals  message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues.  with 53% of uk households now with access to the net  the government  suggests mr davies  could act as an intermediary or  middleman  to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more  cosmopolitan politics  and public trust in policy.  government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online.  but it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic  non-market interactions   said mr davies. there is a role for public bodies like the bbc  libraries  and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of  cliques  talking to each other  he added. the paper is part of the ippr s digital society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of a manifesto for a digital britain.,-1.4060678
1117,business,tsunami slows sri lanka s growth sri lanka s president has launched a reconstruction drive worth $3.5bn (£1.8bn) by appealing for peace and national unity.  president kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict. meanwhile  the international monetary fund (imf) said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from sri lanka s economic growth this year. it estimated the wave left physical damage equal to 6.5% of the economy.  separately  the international labour organisation (ilo) said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in sri lanka and indonesia alone. it called for action to create jobs. president kumaratunga attended a ceremony in the southern town of hambantota. she was joined by government and opposition politicians  together with buddhist  hindu  muslim and christian clergy.  prime minister mahinda rajapakse laid the foundation stone on a new housing project intended to provide 6 000 homes for survivors of the tsunami. mrs kumaratunga called for the tragedy to be  the start of a new beginning to rebuild our nation .  we are a country blessed with so many natural resources and we have not made use of them fully. instead we have been squabbling  fighting   she added. norway s peace negotiator erik solheim is due to arrive on wednesday to try to revive peace talks in the decades-long conflict between government forces and the tamil tigers  who want a separate state in the north east of the country. reconstruction efforts in eastern sri lanka have been hampered by tensions between the two sides.  the imf said that the sri lankan authorities  initial estimates have put the physical damage at $1.3 to $1.5bn  but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this.  the broader macroeconomic impact will clearly be substantial but the details are difficult to assess at this early stage   the imf said. growth  inflation  the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs.  the fishing industry has been devastated  agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer  especially in the short term   the report said. the ilo estimated that 400 000 sri lankans have lost their jobs  mostly in these three industries. earnings from tourism this year are expected to be 15% lower than last year. economic growth this year is expected to be 4%  which is about 1% less than previously forecast. inflation could climb to 14% compared to a previous estimate of 12%. although major exports have not suffered  the imf expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments. foreign exchange reserves may become strained as  sri lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre-tsunami level  which totalled more than two months worth of imports. last week  the imf approved sri lanka s request for a freeze on loan repayments.,-0.2533331

874,entertainment,a-listers flock to gervais sitcom hollywood actors samuel l jackson and ben stiller have signed up for ricky gervais  new sitcom  the comedian has told bbc news.  he said they had both seen the scripts and had agreed to appear in an episode each of the sitcom extras. they join british stars jude law and kate winslet who have been booked for guest roles. the comic and actor said he had drawn up an a-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it.  we wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct   gervais told bbc news.   it s not about the zeitgeist. we wanted people who would still be around in 20 years  not just the winner of big brother to take part.  gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line. but he has met with stiller and jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it.   i didn t want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who haven t even been asked.  i have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as i m going to be in a remake of 10 taking dudley moore s part. i haven t been approached and i wouldn t take it anyway.   he said stiller and jackson would be playing  twisted  versions of themselves in extras and that the jokes about them  would sail pretty close to the bone . gervais and his writing partner stephen merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series  in which gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars. meanwhile  gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book flanimals which is released in the us in march  around the same time as nbc begin showing the us version of the office. the film rights to flanimals have already been snapped up but gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly.  a film will happen over the next three years but i don t want it to be a $50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldn t be another spider-man or batman. i would like to do something small on tv with it first.,-0.41288805
55,politics,vouchers  to cut winter deaths  pensioners are being promised energy savings by the liberal democrats  as snow and cold temperatures continue.  the party says the plans could save the average pensioner £100 every year and cut winter deaths. the government gives £200 for winter fuel to households with people over 60  or £300 where people are over 80. the tories promise to keep the payments. the lib dems would allow people to swap these winter fuel payments for discounts on home insulation. shadow local government secretary ed davey said:  the current scheme has helped some older people  but this new liberal democrat approach will go much further to end the scandal of tens of thousands of old people dying from the winter cold every year.  the vouchers are designed to let pensioners choose from a list of approved energy supplies who would compete for business by offering discounts on home insulation schemes. the plan would boost energy conservation  says the party - and insulation could save £100 every year for pensioner households  so using the money more  intelligently  than at present.,4.559875
45,entertainment,franz man seeks government help franz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians  while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion.   for any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well   he said. but kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with mps  at the university of edinburgh event.  i think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them   he said.  kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotland s role in making 21st century music.  there are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they aren t self-sufficient   he said.  but so-called commercial music would benefit from investment as well.  he warned musicians against being allied to a particular party  however.  i don t know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea.   kapranos and his glasgow four-piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next week s brit awards  including best group and best album. their self-titled debut album won last year s mercury music prize and spawned three top 20 singles. he told the 300-strong audience at the university s reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes.  we say  i like this . because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual  i m riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy  i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because i m upbeat and i like to party  i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning.  kapranos said there was a general  hostility  towards classical music  adding:  there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fm.   he concluded:  we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity.  fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed:  we need to rediscover our ability to listen.  previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking. kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as  more daunting by a long way  than their upcoming brits performance.  i don t really care about the brits   he said.  it s going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight.   i think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues. also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels.  rather than expecting the government - i.e. the taxpayer - to fork out  why don t some of the megastars put something back in  some of britain s wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums  concerts etc. there are far more important demands on government funds.  if they can fund football  why not fund music   areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants  so why not music  we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music. the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash.  the government has enough problems funding schools and health services. if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.  as a scot living in england  i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success  so i can see no problem with it! franz ferdinand  travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world  so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods!  i think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state  the answer is most definitely no. those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn t be looking for government subsidies. i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship.  yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.  there are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around  twiddling their thumbs on the  new deal . getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.  as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move. i would hate to see more pop idol-type funding of music though  as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about.  only if the proposals make financial sense. franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they d had a government grant to get started they d have more than paid it back by now  so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out. however  the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they re a musician. the government shouldn t  fund  music - it should  invest  in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.  i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise. the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people. however  i do feel this should be the extent of their role  to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there.  i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately  the directors are in the business for! if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn t have to fork out a great deal.  yeah  why not  music should be government funded  particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff. pop music pretty much rules the earth  so more attention should go to the other fraternities  i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer. there is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy. perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol-style music - that is  the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. call it a tax on music  pollution   if you like.  though i really like franz ferdinand  i have to disagree with mr kapranos. once government gets their hand into the private sector  it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues. many years ago  this was the case with the us nea  when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting. the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations  like save the music in the us.,-0.50627995
793,tech,doors open at biggest gadget fair thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in las vegas for the annual consumer electronics show (ces).  the fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. about 50 000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. microsoft chief bill gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation xbox.  the thrust of this year s show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store  listen to  and watch what they want on devices any time  anywhere. about 120 000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging  storage technologies  thinner flat screen and high-definition tvs  wireless and portable technologies  gaming  and broadband technologies. the show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as intel  microsoft  and hewlett packard among others.  the story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them   jeff joseph  from the consumer electronics association (cea) told the bbc news website.  it is about personalisation - taking your mp3 player and creating your own playlist  taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.   consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004  according to figures released by ces organisers  the cea  on tuesday. the gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the us in 2004. shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. that trend is predicted to continue  according to cea analysts  with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. the fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank dvd media  liquid crystal display (lcd) tvs  digital video recorders (dvrs)  and portable music players.  this year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your pvr [personal video recorder] in your living room  you can move that content around the house.  some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere   said mr joseph. he said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the  democratisation  of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music  video  and images. there will also be more focus on the design of technologies  following the lead that apple s ipod made  with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.  the cea predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. gaming would continue to thrive  especially on mobile devices  and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. games consoles sales have been declining  but the launch of next generation consoles  such as microsoft s xbox and playstation  could buoy up sales. although it has been widely predicted that mr gates would be showcasing the new xbox  some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. some have suggested the announcement may take place at the games developers conference in the summer instead. with more than 52% of us homes expected to have home networks  the cea suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images  video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home  will be more commonplace. portable devices that combine mobile telephony  digital music and video players  will also be more popular in 2005. their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films  tv  and audio wherever they are. this means more storage technologies will be in demand  such as external hard drives  and flash memory like sd cards. ces runs officially from 6 to 9 january.,-1.2704916
1511,sport,dogged federer claims dubai crown world number one roger federer added the dubai championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by ivan ljubicic.  top seed federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. but ljubicic  who beat tim henman in the last eight  dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool  though  turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. the match was a re-run of last week s final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam  where federer triumphed  but not until ljubicic had stretched him all the way.  i really wanted to get off to a good start this time  and i did  and i could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm   federer said.   that took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and i almost ran away with it. but he came back  and that was a good effort on his side.  ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set.  i didn t start badly  but then suddenly i felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. and with roger  if you relax for a second it just goes very quick   he said.  after those first three games it was no match at all. i don t know  it was really weird. i was playing really well the whole year  and then suddenly i found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court.  but despite his defeat  the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance.  i had a chance in the third  and for me it s really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against roger to win the match.  it s an absolutely great boost to my confidence that i m up there and belong with top-class players.,0.4911604
1896,business,turkey turns on the economic charm three years after a gruelling economic crisis  turkey has dressed its economy to impress.  as part of a charm offensive - ahead of 17 december  when the european union will decide whether to start entry talks - turkey s economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements. the economy is growing fast  they insist. education levels among its young and large population are rising. unemployment levels  in percentage terms  are heading fast towards single digits. inflation is under control. a new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards. the tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to $21bn (£10.8bn) in three years.  moreover  government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled. income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract $15bn of foreign investment over the next three years. a loan restructuring deal with the international monetary fund (imf) is pretty much in the can. and following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts  its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent.  the point of all this has been to convince europe s decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the eu  allowing turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits.   the cake will be bigger for everybody   said deputy prime minister abdullatif sener earlier this month.  turkey will not be a burden for the eu budget.  if admitted into the eu  turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros ($8bn; £6bn) to its budget by 2014  according to a recent impact study by the country s state planning organisation. as turkey s gross domestic output (gdp) is set to grow by 6% per year on average  its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020. turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in  old europe  once its population comes of age. by 2014  one in four turks - or about 18 million people - will be aged 14 or less.  a literate and qualified turkish population   insisted mr sener   will make a positive impact on the eu.   this runs contrary to the popular view that turkey is getting ready to dig deep into eu taxpayers  wallets. however  turkey s assertions are confirmed by brussels  own impact studies  which indeed say that turkish membership would be good news for the eu economy. but only over time. costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkey s membership  with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and  according to some predictions  balloon to 33.5bn euros. this would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid  though such payments should decline as the country s farm sector  which currently employs one in three turks  would employ just one in five by 2020.  such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by turkey s government would never be delivered  say those who feel the turkish project should be shunned.  some fear that rather than providing an educated  sophisticated labour force for europe at large  the people who will leave turkey to seek work abroad will be poor  uneducated - and plentiful. more recently  less palatable concerns - at least in liberal european circles - have been voiced  with senior eu or member state officials talking darkly of a  river of islam   an  oriental  culture and a threat to europe s  cultural richness . of course  many opponents are politically motivated - their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country s muslim traditions to well-documented concerns about the government s human rights record. yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand.  critics insist that much of the optimism about turkey s economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a 134% rise in the country s current account deficit to $10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year.  the country s massive debt - which includes $23bn owed to the imf and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the eu.  in the new member states of the european union  gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product   says reza moghadam  assistant director of the imf s european department.  at about 80% of gdp  turkey s gross debt is double that figure.  turkey s debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country s devastating recession.  there is no question that although turkey is doing much better than in the past  it remains quite vulnerable   says michael deppler  director of the imf s european department.  its debt is far too high for an emerging economy.  a key factor for eu decision makers should be whether or not turkey has met its economic criteria. but economics is not a science. and although the state of turkey s economy is important  as is its pace of reform  the final decision on 17 december will be taken by politicians who will  of course  be guided by their political instincts.,-1.1482844
644,tech,rings of steel combat net attacks gambling is hugely popular  especially with tech-savvy criminals.  many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid. but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk s biggest net firms to stop these attacks. increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures.  net firms are realising that it s not just about anti-virus and firewalls   said paul king  chief security architect at cisco.  there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres.  mr king said the only way to properly combat these so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems. many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres  so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting  said mr king. this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale.  malcolm seagrave  security expert at energis  said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time. bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen  he said.  it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing   he said.  so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data  said mr seagrave. however  he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted. maria capella  spokeswoman for net provider pipex  said that when ddos attacks were at their height  customers were getting hit every four to five days. the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites.  it s about understanding what s genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site   she said.  we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that s when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack   said ms capella. this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries  each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.  typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus. hijacked computers are known as zombies or  bots and collections of them are called  bot nets. many spammers rent out  bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail.  most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult. often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen.  the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail   said ms capella.  we ask  as part of the service we provide  that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning.  once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up. energis took a similar approach  said mr seagrave.  we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together   said mr seagrave. also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from. information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests. he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target.  we have people in places where they shouldn t be  monitoring tech sites   he said. sometimes though  he said  spotting the next victim was easy.  you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites  trying one after another   said mr seagrave.,0.4647751
1297,tech,microsoft debuts security tools microsoft is releasing tools that clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware.  the virus-fighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to microsoft releasing dedicated anti-virus software. also being released is a software utility that will help users find and remove any spyware on their home computer. although initially free it is thought that soon microsoft will be charging users for the anti-spyware tool.  the anti-spyware tool is available now and the anti-virus utility is expected to be available later this month. microsoft s windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited. it has proved such a tempting target that there are now thought to be more than 100 000 viruses and other malicious programs in existence. latest research suggests that new variants of viruses are being cranked out at a rate of up to 200 per week. spyware is surreptitious software that sneaks on to home computers  often without users  knowledge. in its most benign form it just bombards users with pop-up adverts or hijacks web browser settings. the most malicious forms steal confidential information or log every keystroke that users make. surveys have shown that most pcs are infested with spyware. research by technology firms earthlink and webroot revealed that 90% of windows machine have the malicious software on board and  on average  each one harbours 28 separate spyware programs. before now microsoft has left the market for pc security software to specialist firms such as symantec  mcafee  trend micro and many others. it said that its virus cleaning program would not stop machines being infected nor remove the need for other anti-virus programs. on spyware freely available programs such as ad-aware and spybot have become widely used by people keen to keep the latest variants at bay. microsoft s two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years. in 2003 it bought romanian firm gecad software to get hold of its anti-virus technology. in december 2004 it bought new york-based anti-spyware firm giant company software. last year microsoft also released the sp2 upgrade for windows xp that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their anti-virus and firewall programs.,3.1493752
2153,tech,set your television to wow television started off as a magical blurry image. then came the sharpness  the colour and the widescreen format. now the tv set is taking another leap forward into a crystal clear future  although those in europe will have to be patient.  after years of buzz about high-definition tv (hdtv) it is finally taking off in a handful of countries around the world  mainly the us and japan. if you believe the hype  then hdtv will so wow you  that you will never want to go back to your old telly.  hdtv is just the latest must-have technology in viewers  homes   says jo flaherty  a senior broadcaster with the cbs network in the us. all television images are made up of pixels  going across the screen  and scan lines going down. british tv pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. by contrast  hdtv offers up to 1 080 active lines  with each line made up of 1 920 pixels. the result is a picture which can be up to six times as sharp as standard tv. but to get the full impact  programmes need to be broadcast in this format and you need a hdtv set to receive them. most new computer displays are already capable of handling high-resolution pictures. viewers in japan  the us  australia  canada and south korea are already embracing the new tv technology  with a selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format  which includes 5.1 digital surround sound.  but tv viewers in europe will have to wait to enjoy the eye-blasting high-definition images.  many high-end european tv programmes  such as the recent athens olympics  are already being produced in high-definition. but they still reach your screen in the old 625 lines. the prospects for getting sharper images soon do not seem very encouraging. according to consultants strategy analytics  only 12% of homes in europe will have tvs capable of showing programmes in high-definition by 2008. but the hdtv hype spilling out of the us and japan has spurred european broadcasters and consumer electronic companies to push for change. big sports and entertainment events are set to help trigger the general public s attention. the 2006 world cup in germany will be broadcast in high-definition.  in the uk  satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in 2006. there is already a hdtv service in europe called euro1080. other european broadcasters  especially in france and germany  also aiming to launch similar services.  in britain  digital satellite and cable are largely seen as the natural home for hdtv  at least while a decision is taken regarding terrestrial broadcast options. the communications watchdog ofcom could hand over some terrestrial frequencies freed up when the uk switches off its analogue tv signal. for now  broadcasters like the bbc are working on their own hdtv plans  although with no launch date in sight.  the bbc will start broadcasting in hdtv when the time is right  and it would not be just a showcase  but a whole set of programming   says andy quested  from the bbc s high-definition support group.  we have made the commitment to produce all our output in high-definition by 2010  which would put us on the leading edge.  one of the options under consideration is to offer high-definition pictures on the web. the bbc has already dipped its toe into this  including some hdtv content in recent trials of its interactive media player - a video player for pcs. it is planning to offer special releases of selected flagship programmes online in the near future. according to mr quested  this could help put europe back into the running in the race to switch to hdtv. this is backed by recent research which suggests that the number of europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months  with the web eating into tv viewing habits.,0.46655893
512,tech,digital guru floats sub-$100 pc nicholas negroponte  chairman and founder of mit s media labs  says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).  he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. he said one laptop per child could be   very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family  village and neighbourhood . he said the child could use the laptop like a text book. he described the device as a stripped down laptop  which would run a linux-based operating system   we have to get the display down to below $20  to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.   the second trick is to get rid of the fat   if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.  the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture  though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital  now widely seen as predicting the digital age. the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine  where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.  while the idea was popular amongst the children  it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. however  mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops.  we put in 25 laptops three years ago   only one has been broken  the kids cherish these things  it s also a tv a telephone and a games machine  not just a textbook.  mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious.  nokia make 200 million cell phones a year  so for us to claim we re going to make 200 million laptops is a big number  but we re not talking about doing it in three or five years  we re talking about months.  he plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order.  in china they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. that s for five or six years  so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that s cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.,0.58601046

1926,tech,norway upholds  napster  ruling a norwegian student who ran a website which linked to downloadable mp3 files has been ordered to pay compensation by the country s supreme court.  frank allan bruvik was ordered to pay 100 000 kroner (£8 000) to the music industry in norway. he was a student when he set up his napster.no site  which allowed users to submit and receive links to mp3 files. bruvik had earlier been cleared on appeal after a lower court had found for the music industry. music industry bosses in norway said the ruling would help build confidence in the internet as a distribution medium.  frank allan bruvik set up the napster.no website as part of a school project in 2001 while studying computer engineering in the norwegian town of lillehammer. the website was not associated with the napster.com site in the usa  which had been operating since 1999 and was already facing legal action.  bruvik s site was online between august and november 2001  and while it did not host any music  at its peak it was providing links to more than 170 free files on other servers. as well as providing links  the site allowed those visiting it to submit links that could later be accessed by other visitors. a legal complaint for copyright violation was filed by groups including norway s performing rights society  tono  and the norwegian branches of sony music and universal music  who saw it as an important test of principle.  a norwegian court ruled in 2003 that bruvik would have to pay 100 000 kroner to the music industry  but the country s court of appeal cleared him  saying that the copyright violation occurred when others posted the music. however  the supreme court stated that the music was clearly published in violation of copyright law it added that the case was decided based on the responsibility for abetting an illegal act  and that bruvik s actions were premeditated. norway s music industry said it was satisfied with the ruling  because showed that music piracy would not be accepted.  meanwhile  in the usa a further 717 lawsuits against people alleged to have traded copyrighted songs were filed this week by the recording industry association of america. the suits  brought on behalf of the major record companies  cite the individuals for illegally distributing music via unauthorized peer-to-peer services such as kazaa and edonkey. as with preceding cases  the fresh action was made against so-called  john doe  defendants  who are identified only by the codes given to their computers  internet connections.,-3.0511942

1362,tech,mobile multimedia slow to catch on there is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular. consumers swapping old phones for slinkier  dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a 26% increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of 2004  according to analysts gartner more than 167 million handsets were sold between july and september 2004  a period that  according to gartner analyst carolina milanesi is  seldom strong . but although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps  sounds and video clips few  so far  are taking the chance to do so.  in fact  the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures  audio and video is growing. figures gathered by continental research shows that 36% of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (mms)  up from 7% in 2003. this is despite the fact that  during the same period  the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to 7.5 million. getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying. the problem they face  said shailendra jain  head of mms firm adamind  is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets.   also   he said   they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it.  research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to. according to continental research  29% of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation. only 11% regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message. the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people s reluctance to start sending them  said mr jain.  they ask themselves:  if i m streaming video from one handset to another will it work    he said.  there s a lot of user apprehension about that.   there are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might. andrew bud  executive chairman of messaging firm mblox  said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system.  the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant   he said. the reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users.  no-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped  said mr bud. this has led to operators finding other technologies  particularly one known as wap-push  to get multimedia to their customers. but when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers  the results can be dramatic. israeli technology firm celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth. one of the first firms to use the celltick service is hutch india  the largest mobile firm in the country. the broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems. while not multimedia messaging  such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content. as a result 40% of the subscribers to the hutch alive  which uses celltick s broadcast technology  regularly click for more pictures  sounds and images from the operator.  operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers   said yaron toren  spokesman for celltick. until then  multimedia will be a message that is not getting through.,1.2409148

2105,politics,profile: david blunkett before he resigned the position of home secretary on wednesday  david blunkett had been in charge of a substantial body of government portfolios including race  policing and immigration.  his responsibilities in running the home office included civil emergencies  security  terrorism and expenditure. named home secretary after the 2001 general election  mr blunkett had seen the focus on his office intensify. the attacks on the world trade center on 11 september 2001 heightened concern for security and immigration in particular. a labour loyalist from a working class background mr blunkett  57  had been unafraid of pushing for tough changes to labour policy.  recently the issue of identity cards had provoked controversy with questions raised over cost and invasions of civil liberties. mr blunkett was also at the centre of a humiliating scandal involving the former immigration minister beverly hughes. having received his full backing  ms hughes was forced to resign in april over abuses in the visa processing system  which she claimed to be unaware of. mr blunkett s own comments on immigration had prompted censure - he told refugees from afghanistan and kosovo to  get back home  to start rebuilding their countries. and he also urged people from ethnic minorities to develop a  sense of belonging  in britain  telling them to speak english at home. avoiding political correctness is second nature to the former home secretary  who spurns a metropolitan elite and  airy fairy libertarians  and earlier in the year coined the phrase  liberati   as an amalgam of  glitterati  and  liberal . yet in january of this year he courted further controversy over his seemingly liberal reclassification of cannabis  from a grade b to grade c status drug .  before the recent furore  mr blunkett had always appeared more interested in politics than his personal life. mr blunkett told the daily telegraph in 2001 that he continued to wear his wedding ring  in spite of being a divorcee  as  a useful way of ensuring that people don t casually think i am available . he added:  i am not available because i am just getting on with the job.  mr blunkett entered parliament for sheffield brightside in 1987  after first contesting the sheffield hallam seat in 1974. he is one of very few blind mps  and was the first to reach the front bench and the cabinet. his relaxed performances - with his guide dog by his side - at the despatch box  in the labour party s national executive  and on the conference platform made it easy to forget his disability. mr blunkett himself described not being able to see as simply  an inconvenience . using braille for speeches  and briefed by his officials on tape  he also has a sharp tongue at times  and a pragmatic approach to politics.  mr blunkett was schooled in sheffield where he led the city council for seven years before entering the commons. he chaired the labour party nationally  and was a unifying force in the 80s and 90s  shadowing health and education. in tony blair s first government mr blunkett was put in charge of education and employment  where he won big increases in funds for schools  while insisting on improved standards of literacy and numeracy. he was prepared to stand up to the teaching unions - which sometimes heckled his speeches - and his policy of charging university students for tuition fees was not popular. in the labour party he has been regarded as a loyal colleague  a conciliator who avoids factions  and a man whose humour and determination make him widely popular. there have been wry smiles as well. in 1999  his then guide dog lucy threw up in the chamber during the speech of his tory opponent. lucy was replaced by her half-sister  sadie  a black labrador-curly-coated retriever cross  in 2003 after nearly a decade by mr blunkett s side.,1.1379671

1928,business,ukraine strikes turkmen gas deal ukraine has agreed to pay 30% more for natural gas supplied by turkmenistan.  the deal was sealed three days after turkmenistan cut off gas supplies in a price dispute that threatened the ukrainian economy. supplies from turkmenistan account for 45% of all natural gas imported by ukraine  which has large coal deposits but no gas fields. turkmenistan is also trying to strike a similar deal with russia  which is not so dependent on its gas. turkmen president saparmurat niyazov  who signed the contract  said the turkmen side agreed to lower the price demanded by $2 per 1 000 cubic metres  bringing it down to $58. but the new price is still $14 higher than the price fixed in the contract for 2004. the head of the ukrainian state-owned naftohaz company  yury boyko  said he was  fully happy  with the deal. on friday  turkmenistan acted on a threat and shut off gas supplies to ukraine in attempt to bring the price dispute to a head. mr niyazov said that his government would insist on the same price for supplies to russia. analysts say thay may not happen as russia  the world s leading gas producer  needs the cheap turkmen gas only to relieve is state-owned gazprom from costly investment in the exploration of oil fields in siberia. turkmenistan is the second-largest gas producer in the world.,-0.5868783

1566,tech,creator of first apple mac dies jef raskin  head of the team behind the first macintosh computer  has died.  mr raskin was one of the first employees at apple and made many of the design decisions that made the mac so distinctive when it was first released. he led the team that decided to use a graphical interface and mouse that let people navigate around the computer by pointing and clicking. the 1984 release of the mac reflected mr raskin s belief that good design should make computers easy to use.  mr raskin joined apple in 1978 as employee number 31  initially to lead the company s publications department. however  in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap  aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use.  the result was the 1984 macintosh that did away with the then common text-based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents. users navigated around the machine using a mouse and by pointing  clicking and dragging. although now in common use in almost all computers  these methods were pioneering when first used in the macintosh. the gui was developed by xerox parc  and used in its star machine. but the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by apple in its pioneering lisa computer.  his role on the macintosh was the initiator of the project  so it wouldn t be here if it weren t for him   said andy hertzfeld  an early macintosh team member. although mr raskin drove the team that created the macintosh he did not stay at apple to see it released. in 1981 he was removed from the project following a dispute with apple s mercurial boss steve jobs. in 1982  mr raskin left apple entirely. the macintosh was reputedly named after mr raskin s favourite apple  though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company. after leaving apple  mr raskin founded another company called information appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers. he was also an accomplished musician  played three instruments and conducted san francisco s chamber opera society. mr raskin was diagnosed in december 2004 with pancreatic cancer and died on 26 february at his home in california.,-4.190631

830,sport,chelsea hold arsenal a gripping game between arsenal and chelsea ended with the honours finishing even at highbury.  thierry henry produced a sublime strike to put arsenal ahead but john terry levelled with a powerful header. henry s quickly-taken free-kick put arsenal back in front but eidur gudjohnsen equalised with a header from william gallas  knockback. henry missed a golden chance when he blazed a shot high late on and arsenal also had a penalty appeal rejected. henry s opener had given arsenal the perfect start and set up an enthralling affair. the french striker headed a long cesc faregas ball back to jose antonio reyes from the edge of the chelsea area and immediately saw it headed back into his path from the spaniard. and  with his back to goal  henry finished with aplomb when he took one touch  turned and struck an angled strike past the despairing dive of keeper petr cech. henry epitomised a determination about the arsenal side but chelsea appeared unruffled and equalised after 16 minutes.  gunners keeper manuel almunia  who got the nod ahead of jens lehmann  did well to save a well-struck frank lampard shot. but he could not keep out terry s powered header from the resultant corner as arsenal s weakness at set-pieces was again exposed. almost immediately  henry went close and chelsea gathered the loose ball before going straight up the other end where gudjohnsen fluffed an effort. gudjohnsen did not make the same error minutes later when he struck a sweet shot only for almunia to be equal to the task and save. the homes side regained the lead in controversial fashion when robert pires won a dubious free-kick. and  given the option to take the 25-yard set-piece quickly  henry curled in a shot with cech still organising his wall.  this time arsenal did not allow chelsea to level so soon as they went into the break ahead. chelsea brought striker didier drogba on to partner gudjohnsen up front after the interval and the move reaped immediate reward. lampard swung in a cross which gallas knocked back across goal and a deft header from gudjohnsen levelled matters again. chelsea s main threat was coming from crosses and lampard missed a great opportunity as he headed wide when left unmarked at the far post. the second half failed to live up to the thrilling pace of the opening period but there were flashes of brilliance. one of them came from the enigmatic robben when he jinked his way through two arsenal defenders only to see his poked shot saved by almunia.  arsenal ended the match the stronger and worked a excellent chance for henry who put a left-foot shot high from eight yards. subtitute robin van persie could also have nicked a win for the highbury outfit but frustratingly sidefooted just wide. matthieu flamini had a late penal appeal waved away before the final whistle which maintained chelsea five-point premiership lead over arsenal.  almunia  lauren  toure  campbell  cole  pires  flamini  fabregas  reyes (clichy 82)  bergkamp (van persie 82)  henry. subs not used: senderos  hoyte  lehmann.  cole.  henry 2  29.  cech  paulo ferreira  ricardo carvalho (drogba 45)  terry  gallas  duff  tiago (bridge 45)  makelele  lampard  robben  gudjohnsen (parker 77). subs not used: kezman  cudicini.  robben  drogba  lampard.  terry 17  gudjohnsen 46.  38 153  g poll (hertfordshire).,1.7647943

2053,tech,domain system opens door to scams a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers  a trade body has warned.  the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force. but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language.  registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers  says stephen dyer  director of ukif. domain names are the  real language  addresses of websites  rather than their internet protocol address  which is a series of numbers. they are used so people can more easily navigate the web. so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used. so  for example  website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet. the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian  a  look just like an english  a . but the computer code would be different  and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. this is more than just a theory. a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name (idn) system  said mr dyer. as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent  mr dyer said.  although the idn problem is well known in technical circles  the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked   said mr dyer.   it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site   he added. there are solutions. for instance  browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world s browsers. another solution  to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of  throwing out the baby with the bath water   he said. centr  the council of european national top level domain registries  agrees.  a rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world   the organisation said in a statement.,4.0189276

117,politics,chancellor rallies labour voters gordon brown has issued a rallying cry  telling supporters the  stakes are too high  to stay at home or protest vote in the forthcoming general election.  the chancellor said the vote - expected to fall on 5 may - will give a  clear and fundamental  choice between labour investment and conservative cuts. speaking at labour s spring conference in gateshead  mr brown claimed the nhs was not safe in conservative hands. he said tory plans to cut £35bn tax would  cut deep into public service .  to a packed audience at gateshead s sage centre  the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor oliver letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher  gp and nurse in the country  he told activists. laying into the conservative s record in government he said:  i give you this promise - with labour  britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10% inflation  15% interest rates  £3bn in lost reserves  250 000 repossessed  one million in negative equity and three million unemployed.  never again tory boom and bust.   this will be the central dividing line at the election  between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services  and a labour government taking britain forward  which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals  schools and public services and  i am proud to say  spend by 2008 £60bn more.  turning to the economy  the chancellor pledged to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.  he said after seven years labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to  the only party trusted with the economy . it was now a  party not just of employees  but of employers and managers   he said. in the speech - which prompted a standing ovation from an audience clearly  warm  to mr brown - he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. he also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world s poorest countries  a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds and the creation of a network of children s centres and flexibility in maternity leave. the prime minister is to take part later on saturday in an interactive question and answer session  fielding queries sent in by e-mail  text message and telephone as part of labour s attempt to engage the public in their campaign.,2.0866911
1877,business,sa unveils  more for all  budget the south african government has put tax cuts and increased social spending at the centre of its latest budget.  aiming to both stir economic growth and aid the country s poor  finance minister trevor manuel said the focus of the 2005 budget was  more for all . the tax cuts target firms and individuals  cutting corporate tax from 30% to 29% and offering income tax cuts worth 6.8bn rand ($1.2bn; £910m). spending on health and education will rise by 9.4% and 8.1% respectively. spending on housing and sanitation will rise by 12%. all the spending increases will run over the next three years.  unveiling the 418bn-rand budget to parliament  mr manuel said the south african economy had grown by an average of 3.2% over the past four years  slightly below the african average of 4%.  he predicted that the south african economy would grow by 4.3% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2006. mr manuel added that inflation fell to 4.3% in 2004 and is expected to remain at between 3% and 6% from now until at least 2008  helped by interest rates which are at their lowest level in 24 years. given that both corporate and personal taxes are being cut - under the new measures  those earning less than 35 000 rand a year will be exempt from income tax - the extra 22.3bn rand in social spending will be partly met by higher fuel  tobacco and alcohol taxes.   in this budget  the focus is on more for all  not more for some  and not a hell of a lot more for a few  but spread across all of south africa   said mr manuel. he said that the economic situation was a  marked improvement  on the position at the end of apartheid  but acknowledged that more needed to be done to improve the lives and livelihoods of the disadvantaged. about 280 000 jobs a year have been created in south africa since 2000 but unemployment remains high  currently close to 30%. economist colen garrow said the budget looked as if it would stimulate economic growth.  it s pleasant to see the cut in company taxes  it s a good incentive for business   he said.,-0.72719574
99,entertainment,rapper kanye west s shrewd soul us hip-hop star kanye west - who leads the race for this year s grammys with 10 nominations - rose to prominence by producing songs for artists such as jay-z and alicia keys.  he then emerged from his behind-the-scenes role to become an artist as well as a producer. but his solo career almost ended before it began after a near-fatal car crash left west with his jaw wired shut in 2002. the resulting song  through the wire  became west s first uk hit in april 2004 and subsequent album the college dropout became a transatlantic success  both critically and commercially. west  26  began rapping as a teenager at his chicago school  inspired by the beats and rhymes of 1980s pioneers run dmc.  hip-hop producer no id encouraged west to sample old soul and r&b hits then revive them with an updated sound  an approach that would become his trademark.  i feel like a lot of the soul that s in those old records that i sample is in me   he said.  so when i hear them and i put them with the drums and i bring them to the new millennium  it s just like god s doing that. i m one with them records right there. it s a blessing.   leaving his chicago art school after only one year - a move which would later inspire the title of his album - west began his music career co-producing songs for artists mase and the madd rapper. this drew the attention of superstar rapper jay-z  who signed west up to his roc-a-fella record label to produce numerous artists on his roster. west s work gained mainstream recognition when he produced the singles takeover and izzo (hova) on jay-z s own 2001 album blueprint. incorporating samples of five to one by the doors and the jackson five s i want you back respectively  the hits were credited with injecting soul back into hip-hop.  as their success attracted further production work for jay-z ( 03 bonnie & clyde) and artists such as ludacris (stand up) and alicia keys (you don t know my name)  west announced plans for a solo album. driving home from a late-night los angeles recording session in october 2002  he was involved in the car crash that left his jaw fractured in three places.  anytime i hear about any accident my heart sinks in and i just thank god that i m still here   he later said.  that steering wheel could have been two inches further out  and that would have been it.   west s account of the accident sampled chaka khan s hit through the fire to become the heart of his completed solo album the college dropout. released last year  it was by turns smooth  humorous and sharp and largely avoided the clich&#233;d hip-hop preoccupation with guns  girls and jewellery.  through the wire was quickly joined in the uk and us charts by slow jamz  on which west collaborated with rapper twista and ray actor jamie foxx. the college dropout spawned two further uk hits and a string of award nominations. west was shortlisted for 10 grammys - including nominations for artist and album of the year - and took the best hip-hop artist  producer and album titles at last year s music of black origin (mobo) awards. now a respected rapper and producer in the influential field of hip-hop  kanye west is unlikely to regret his decision to leave college early.,-1.8689709

2115,tech,cabs collect mountain of mobiles gadgets are cheaper  smaller and more common than ever. but that just means we are more likely to lose them.  in london alone over the past six months more than 63 000 mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs  according to a survey. that works out at about three phones per cab. over the same period almost 5 000 laptops and 5 800 pdas such as palms and pocket pcs were left in licensed cabs. even the great and good are not immune to losing their beloved gadgets. jemima khan reportedly left her ipod  phone and purse in a cab and asked for them to be returned to her friend who turned out to be hugh grant. as the popularity of portable gadgets has grown  and we trust more of our lives to them  we seem to be forgetting them in ever larger numbers. the numbers of lost laptops has leapt by 71% in the last three years.  this has left londoners  or those travelling by cab in the capital  as the world s best at losing laptops  according to the research by the licensed taxi drivers association and pointsec  a mobile-data backup firm. more than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in london as in any of the nine other cities (helsinki  oslo  munich  paris  stockholm  copenhagen  chicago and sydney) where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out. by contrast danes were most adept at losing mobile phones being seven times more likely to leave it behind in a cab than travellers in germans  norwegians and swedes. top of the range phones can carry enormous amounts of data - enough to hold hundreds of pictures or thousands of contact details. given that few people back up the data on their pc it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around. you could be losing a fair chunk of your life in the back of that cab not least because many people collect numbers on their phone that they do not have anywhere else.  equally  phones let you navigate through contacts by name so many people have completely forgotten their friends  numbers and could not reconstruct them if they had to. this growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as retrofone which lets people buy a cheap old-fashioned phone to replace the tiny  shiny expensive one they have just lost. briton s growing love of phones has also led to the creation of the mobile equipment national database that lets you register the unique id number of your phone so it can be returned to you in the event of it being lost or stolen. according to statistics 50% of all muggings and snatch theft offences involve mobiles. millions of gadgets are now logged in the database and organisations such as transport for london regularly consult it when trying to re-unite folk with their phones and other gadgets. for the drivers  finding a mobile in the back of their cab is one of the more pleasant things many have found. the survey of what else has been left behind included a harp  a dog  a hamster and a baby.,0.6089492
131,entertainment,film production  falls  40% in uk the number of british films produced in the uk fell 40% in 2004  with movies starring johnny depp and jude law among those affected  screen daily has said.  twenty-seven british films were made in the uk last year following a drop in funding  compared with 45 in 2003  according to the trade weekly. it attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the national lottery. uk and us co-productions in britain fell from 102 in 2003 to 81 last year.  last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the uk. several projects were shelved as they faced the implications of this clampdown  coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional sources including the lottery and miramax films. shooting on period drama tulip fever  which was to star jude law and keira knightley  was postponed indefinitely while shooting of the libertine starring johnny depp was moved to the isle of man.   there isn t anything coming in to replace (the funds)   said the libertine s executive producer marc samuelson.  we are in a hiatus.  films with  medium  budgets of up to £9m  a similar level to box office hits vera drake  calendar girls and enduring love  are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown. the strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of us films shot in the uk during 2004  screen international added. big budget co-productions  such as the harry potter series  continued to be shot in the uk  however. the uk film council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for british film production  when bridget jones: the edge of reason  wimbledon and thunderbirds were all filmed in the uk.   the drop was expected as there was no way 2003 s record level of production could be bettered   the council s spokesperson said.  the reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors  including the continuing long-term trend towards co-production of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements.  it was  too early  to predict whether the downward trend in uk production would continue throughout 2005  the uk film council said. in september the government introduced subsidies worth up to £4m per film for medium budget films  under new treasury measures. it is also due to announce a replacement for uk film tax relief scheme section 48 in july.,-3.1747923

698,sport,britain boosted by holmes double athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in 2004 as stunning victories went hand-in-hand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals.  kelly holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the olympic games. holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over team gb after their biggest medal hope  paula radcliffe  dropped out of the marathon and then the 10 000m. britain s men s 4x100m relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold. holmes had started the year in disappointing style  falling over in the final of 1500m at the world indoor championships where she was favourite. her olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the 800m - her first global title. just five days later  the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m. it was the first time in 84 years a briton has achieved the olympic middle-distance double. while holmes left athens as the star of team gb  it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games.  the 30-year-old marathon world record holder went into the athens event as favourite but an exhausted radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears. her decision to enter the 10 000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining.  but radcliffe helped put her olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in november s new york marathon. the 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the british men s olympic squad after a poor start to the games.  it seemed as though athens would be the first games where the men would fail to win a medal with michael east the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. but darren campell  jason gardener  marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis made amends in the sprint relay. the quartet held off favourites the usa to win britain s first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over 60m and  just like holmes  finally lived up to his promise in 2004. kelly sotherton completed team gb s athletics medal haul in athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. the 28-year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003.  but it was a different story for britain s defending champion denise lewis  who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. lewis  who was troubled by injury  has ruled out retiring while sotherton is tipped to build on her success. the athens olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for steve backley  who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. the battling 35-year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one olympic bronze.  and backley s departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete dean macey  who came fourth in athens.  the continued improvement of sprinter abi oyepitan and long jumper chris tomlinson also boosted team gb. sadly  the 2004 olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. on the eve of the games  greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash.  kenteris  the 200m champion in 2000  and thanou have since been charged by the greek authorities and await trial. at the games  adrian annus (hammer)  robert fazelas (discus) and irina korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. hungarian compatriots annus and fazelas both refused to give urine samples while russian korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol.  the fallout from the thg scandal  which rocked the sport in 2003  continued to impact in olympic year. britain s 4x100m team took gold without the services of dwain chambers  who was handed a two-year ban in february after testing positive for steroid thg.  american kelli white was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. and world 400m champion jerome young landed a life ban from us chiefs after a second doping offence. russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the world indoor and olympic titles. her rivalry with compatriot svetlana feofanova livened up the field events. morocco s hicham el guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic olympic double in the 1500m and 5 000m.  and though there was no paula radcliffe in the london marathon  there was plenty of drama as kenyans evans rutto and margaret okayo took the titles. rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut.,1.473089

2170,tech,games win for blu-ray dvd format the next-generation dvd format blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival  according to its backers.  blu-ray  backed by 100 firms including sony  is competing against toshiba and nec-backed hd-dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games. the blu-ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format. the next generation of dvds will hold high-definition video and sound. this offers incredible 3d-like quality of pictures which major hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year. in a separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas  toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005.   as we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images  we have a much greater need for storage   richard doherty  from panasonic s hollywood laboratories  one of the pioneers of blu-ray  told the bbc news website.  so by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today s dvd.  a blu-ray disc will be able to store 50gb of high-quality data  while toshiba s hd-dvd will hold 30gb. mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs  including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders. both toshiba and blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war  akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the 1980s  can be resolved over the next year when next-generation dvd players start to come out. when players do come out  they will be able to play standard dvds too  which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current dvds.  but the support from vivendi and electronics arts is a big boost to blu-ray in the battle for supremacy.  gaming is a $20 billion industry worldwide  so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made.  the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies   said michael heilmann  chief technology officer for vivendi universal.  blu-ray offers the capacity  performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming.  ea  a leading games developer and publisher  added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and blu-ray had the capacity  functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations. mr doherty said gamers were  ravenous  for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles.  gamers  especially those working on pcs  are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures  deeper levels  for delivering higher-resolution playback.   he added:  the focus for games moving forward is on increased immersion.   gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated 3d models and textures and increasing the resolution  increasing the frame rate - all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience.  fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost. as games move to more photo-real capability  the current technology is limiting.  they are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments   said mr doherty. currently  graphics-intensive pc games also require multiple discs for installation. high-definition dvds will cut down on that need. likewise  consoles rely on single discs  so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better  high-resolution games. blu-ray has already won backing from major hollywood studios  such as mgm studios  disney  and buena vista  as well as top technology firms like dell  lg  samsung and phillips amongst others. while toshiba s hd-dvd technology has won backing from paramount  universal and warner bros.  the real world benefits (of hd-dvd) are apparent and obvious   said jim cardwell  president of warner home video. mr cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with hd-dvd. both formats are courting microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation xbox  but discussions are still on-going. next generation dvds will also be able to store images and other data. ces is the largest consumer electronics show in the world  and runs from 6 to 9 january.,-0.39717484

1735,politics,brown calls for £5.5bn aids fund gordon brown has called on rich nations to fund a £5.5bn ($10bn) plan to fight the aids epidemic and find a vaccine.  on the fourth day of his six-day tour of africa  the uk chancellor predicted a vaccine could be found by 2012 if the world stepped up its funding pledges. doubling the £400m being spent yearly on finding such a vaccine could advance it by three years and save six million lives  mr brown said on thursday. he hopes to use the uk s g8 presidency to push the issue forward.   i believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat  cure and eradicate the world s deadliest disease of today - and today the world s least curable disease - hiv/aids - will rightly earn the title  the great generation    mr brown said in a speech during his african tour. the problems of hiv/aids were inseparable from poverty  he added.  at least $10 billion per annum (£5.5bn) is needed to address the hiv/aids crisis in low and middle income countries.  existing financial commitments on their own will not stop the pandemic.  the uk s proposal for an international finance facility is so important - increasing world aid flows by over $50 billion (£27bn). a doubling of world aid to halve world poverty.  mr brown also said he had agreed with the italian finance minister domenico siniscalco to push forward with plans for the world-wide sharing and co-ordination of research into the disease.  currently the private sector was only spending £60m a year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting  mr brown said. he called on industrialised nations to commit themselves to buying the first 300m vaccines at a cost of $20 each  thereby boosting the market for inoculations. this would be a  large enough inducement to create much stronger interest from both large and small pharmaceutical firms   mr brown added.  more must also be done to finance the treatment and care of those living with hiv/aids and their families  he said. but aid charity actionaid criticised mr brown s preoccupation with finding a vaccine and called on g8 nations to fund hiv/aids treatments. the charity s head of hiv/aids in britain  simon wright said:  while encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an hiv vaccine is important  a failure to provide any funding for hiv treatments condemns a generation of people to death.  hiv is decimating african countries  killing the most productive adults who should be working  caring for children and building the economy. an hiv vaccine is probably at least 10 years away. treatments are needed now.  on wednesday  mr brown visited slums in the kenyan capital nairobi . he will visit an hiv/aids orphanage in tanzania and a women s credit union in mozambique before chairing a meeting of the commission for africa in cape town. the chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a g8 aid package which he has likened to the marshall plan used by the united states to rebuild europe after world war two.,1.372091
1914,politics,labour plans maternity pay rise maternity pay for new mothers is to rise by £1 400 as part of new proposals announced by the trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt.  it would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007  ms hewitt told gmtv s sunday programme. other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. the tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as  desperate   while the liberal democrats said it was misdirected.  ms hewitt said:  we have already doubled the length of maternity pay  it was 13 weeks when we were elected  we have already taken it up to 26 weeks.  we are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next parliament.  she said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave  but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid.  we have made a firm commitment. we will definitely extend the maternity pay  from the six months where it now is to nine months  that s the extra £1 400.  she said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner s maternity pay or leave period  or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. the shadow secretary of state for the family  theresa may  said:  these plans were announced by gordon brown in his pre-budget review in december and tony blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.   she said the conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the general election. liberal democrat spokeswoman for women sandra gidley said:  while mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the liberal democrats feel this money is being misdirected.  she said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.  ms hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers  not employers. but david frost  director general of the british chambers of commerce  warned that many small firms could be  crippled  by the move.  while the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government s statutory pay  recruitment costs  advertising costs  retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be   he said. further details of the government s plans will be outlined on monday. new mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth  followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.,1.2763219

1021,tech,format wars could  confuse users  technology firms sony  philips  matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.  the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different  and conflicting  content control systems  experts warned. they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.  currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems. by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system  the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy  appropriately licensed video and music on any device  independent of how they originally obtained that content . the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music  movies and other digital content they have bought. called the marlin joint development association  the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium.  the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft. confusingly for consumers  the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple.  in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats  such as betamax and vhs  that consumers have seen in the past   said ian fogg  personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research.  the difference is that it is very fragmented   he said.  it s not a two-horse race  it s a five  six  seven or even eight-horse race  mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families. although initiatives such as microsoft s  plays for sure  program could help remove some of the uncertainty  he said  life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.  shelley taylor  analyst and author of a report about online music services  said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. apple s itunes service was a perfect example of this  she said.  although itunes has been hugely successful  apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods   she said.  she said rampant competition between online music services  of which there are now 230 according to recent figures  could drive more openness and freer file formats.  it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run   she said   and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.  ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop.  people want portability   she said   and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.  cory doctorow  european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues  expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims.  not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying   he said. he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. instead  said mr doctorow  drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers.  the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the ipod version  the auto version  the american and uk version  the ringtone version  and so on.,-0.15147018
2016,tech,what high-definition will do to dvds first it was the humble home video  then it was the dvd  and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition.  high-definition gives incredible  3d-like pictures and surround sound. the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so  and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out. but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds  it will profoundly change home entertainment. for rick dean  director of business development for digital content company thx  a high-definition future is an exciting prospect. he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy  finding nemo  the incredibles and indiana jones.  there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds   he told the bbc news website.   the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined.  the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master   he says. but currently  putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand.  as much as you compress the picture data rate wise  you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master   he explains.  i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very exciting.   high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to. it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months  time. mr dean is confident though:  i think if they see real hd [high-definition]  not some heavily compressed version of it  there is such a remarkable difference.  i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen.   high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too. on the whole  producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed. equally  it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd.  when we master movies right now  our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second   says mr dean.  our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second.  that s a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about 98%. so if you have anything that allows more space  you don t have to compress so hard.  studios could fit a lot more marketing material  games  and features  onto high-capacity dvds. currently  an entire dvd project can take up to three months  says mr dean. although the step of down-converting will be bypassed  this will realistically only save a day s work  says mr dean. one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems. on the fairly complex star wars disks  making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone. if studios want to cash in on the extra space  it could mean extra human hours  for which someone has to pay.  if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks  it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required.  and if studios do focus on delivering more  added value content   thinks mr dean  ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it. those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd. but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price  studios will listen  thinks mr dean.  high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike. more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous.  when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i  everybody was very sun-tanned  but that was make-up.  in the hd version of episode i  all these make-up lines showed up   explains mr dean. the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too.   there are scans of a corridor [on the death star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots  there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways.  you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn t see it.  what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur. with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas  this line blurs even further. it could also mean that how we get films  and in what format  will widen.  in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip [internet protocol - broadband]  giving a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive   says mr dean. but that is some time off for most  and for now  people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves.,-3.193921
431,politics,blair backs  pre-election budget  tony blair has backed chancellor gordon brown s pre-budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the uk economy.  in a speech in edinburgh  the prime minister said thursday s report reinforced stability and opportunity. and that would be central to labour s next election campaign  planning for which was already well advanced. mr brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.  he told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  no politician should make the mistake that john major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are  they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing.   that is not what politicians should do  it would not be responsible to do.  mr brown insisted his spending plans were  affordable  and he could afford to be optimistic because britain was now a stable  low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. mr blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability  which he said was the  cornerstone  of labour s programme.  in a speech at edinburgh s napier university  he said labour would publish over the next few months  a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term .   in every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future  much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. all of it fits together around common themes of opportunity  security and stability for all   mr blair said. in his pre-budget report  mr brown surprised some city experts by forecasting uk growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts  saying tax receipts have been overestimated. carl emmerson  from the institute for fiscal studies  told bbc news:  he thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will  in fact  be ok. we re not so sure.  david page  of investec securities  said:  his forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of £8bn is way too optimistic.  it s going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets.   conservative shadow chancellor oliver letwin said:  i can t find a single economic forecaster from the imf to the institute of fiscal studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances.  in order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election.  mr letwin accused the chancellor of using  fancy statistics  to hide public service failures. vincent cable  for the liberal democrats  called on mr brown to open up the government s books to the national audit office  to see if he had met his  golden rule .  it is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending   mr cable told mps.,2.6578953

77,sport,hodgson relishes european clashes former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have a winter break - but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elite s bid for champions league glory.  hodgson - now in charge at viking stavanger - was at liverpool s clash with bayer leverkusen at anfield on tuesday as a member of uefa s technical committee. hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe  although not in england - where the champions league contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list. but hodgson told bbc sport that while he believes the premiership should embrace the idea  he does not expect it to cost the english representatives in the last 16 of the champions league.  i just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge.  i am a fervent supporter of the break. it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season  which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league.  the other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage.  the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today  the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed  rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february.  hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages  explaining:  as i said  it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries.   and certainly if i was still a manager in england i would be supporting any calls for its introduction.  in pre-season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players  having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot  find themselves getting very jaded.  the break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and  perhaps more importantly  recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead.  the mental side is by far the most important thing.  hodgson added:  the length of breaks can vary. in italy the break was very short. you just took christmas and new year.  it was so short you didn t do anything. you gave the players a week or 10 days off  then you were training for a week or 10 days and then went into a game.  if it is longer  it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them.  and hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the premiership. he said:  if we talk about football at elite level  which the premiership is  then i would support a winter break.  if you examine the demands of the premier league and  in particular on players who play international football for their club and country  then a break would do them the world of good - physically and mentally.,0.45804787
141,business,us seeks new $280bn smoker ruling the us justice department is to try to overturn a court ruling that threw out its claim for $280bn (£149bn) in damages from tobacco firms.  earlier this month  a three-judge appeal court panel rejected the claim - filed in 1999 by the administration of bill clinton - in a 2-1 decision. government lawyers said they would ask the full us court of appeals for the district of columbia to hear the case. the court room battle is seen as key in government attempts to fight smoking.  it s pretty clear that they ve suffered a severe setback   said anthony sebok  a professor at brooklyn law school  adding that the appeal was what the government  would be expected to ask for .  prosecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking  ignored research that highlighted problems  looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts. among the firms accused were altria group  rj reynolds tobacco  lorillard tobacco  liggett group and brown and williamson. prosecutors went after the companies using legislation put in place to fight organised crime  and accused the firms of conspiring and running  racketeer influenced and corrupt organisations . the tobacco companies denied the charges  saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public. they also said that they have met many of the government s demands laid out in a landmark $206bn settlement hammered out in 1998 with 46 states. a three-judge panel agreed with the companies  finding that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws.  central to the government s case was a meeting in the plaza hotel  new york  on 15 december  1953. prosecutors contend that executives from the major tobacco firms met and agreed to present a unified strategy denying the harmful effects of smoking. despite denying for decades that smoking could be linked to illness  the companies have modified their stances in recent years. altria s philip morris now accepts that nicotine is harmful  and the company s main lawyer william ohlemeyer told the bbc last year that earlier statements may have been wrong but they were not dishonest. government lawyers have until 21 march to file their appeal.,-0.117272854
1014,politics,howard dismisses tory tax fears michael howard has dismissed fears from some conservatives that his plans for £4bn tax cuts are too modest.  he defended the package  saying it was a plan for the tories  first budget and he hoped to be able to go further. the tories on monday highlighted £35bn in  wasteful  spending they would stop to allow tax cuts  reduced borrowing and more spending on key services. labour and the liberal democrats say the party s sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. the tory tax plan follows complaints from some of the party s mps that mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin have taken too long to unveil the proposals. now they have promised a figure but have yet to reveal which taxes would be targeted.  tory backbencher edward leigh said the proposals were a step in the right direction but he told the financial times:  i would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts.  interviewed on bbc radio 2 s jeremy vine show  mr howard said:  it is perfectly true that i am being attacked on one side by people who think we ought to be promising much  much bigger tax cuts and spending cuts.   on the other side  there are people who say we won t be able to achieve these tax cuts.  i think we have got it about right.  mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes. he added:  i would like to be able to do more  and over time i am sure we will be able to do more  but at the start  we have got to recognise there is a limit to what we can do in one go  in our first budget.  i have got to be responsible about this.   the latest tory plans came as campaigning for the election - widely expected in may - gathered pace. the liberal democrats launched their pre-election platform  with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the  authentic opposition   particularly on the iraq war  council tax and university tuition fees. lib dem treasury spokesman vince cable also branded the tory plans as  fantasy economics . labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing a  fraudulent prospectus . the party on tuesday challenged the tories to publish the full report from david james  the trouble-shooter they asked to identify possible savings. but the tories are in turn demanding that tony blair spell out which taxes he would raise if he wins the election.,3.859287
1904,tech,no half measures with half-life 2 could half-life 2 possibly live up to the hype  after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it s safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time.  fortunately  it doesn t merely live up to its promise  but exceeds it. no-one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long. the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped. all the money - or indeed time - is on the screen. the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman  the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 half-life. having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster-infested research facility  he s back in another foreboding troublespot - the enigmatic city 17. it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city  but as soon as your train pulls in to the station  it s clear that all is not well here. sinister police patrol the unkempt streets  and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer. a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be.  you are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom-fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task. it is not immediately explained what your objectives are  nor precisely why everything is so ravaged. finding out step-by-step is all part of the experience  although you never fully get to understand what it was all about. that does not really matter. hl2 does not waste energy blinding you with plot. underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective  and immerses the player in the most vivid  convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen. there are no cut-scenes to interrupt the flow. exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you.  whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride  wandering through half-life s world truly does feel like being part of a movie.  considering its sophistication  the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications. but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pc s components  this is it. on our test machine - an alienware system with an athlon 3500+ processor and ati s radeon x800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble  and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping. it is not simply that the surfaces  textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy  but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them. the haunting  grim landscapes become strangely beautiful. luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings. so impressive are the physics that you ll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move. there are puzzles to be solved along the way  pitched at about the right difficulty  but most progress is achieved by force. freeman is quickly reunited with the original game s famous crowbar  and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow.  virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with  and in realistic fashion. you will be wowed by the attention-to-detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls  chase a pigeon out of your way  or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed. at times half-life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to  and in a curious way  its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome. running around on foot is great enough  but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun. human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones. the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles. in gameplay terms  hl2 somehow gets almost everything perfect. and without resorting to the zombies-leaping-out-of-shadows approach of doom iii  it s all incredibly unsettling. the vacant environment is distinctly eerie  and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside.  the game does have a couple of problems. firstly  the carefully-scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people.  a lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue  which makes for exciting moments  but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you ve completed it. if you like things open-ended and free-ranging  far cry will be a lot more pleasing. but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run. installing it proved a life-draining siege that would test a saint s patience. developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy. the box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure  but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded. the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed  the temperamental valve servers and the time of day  but it can take hours. it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily  half-life 2 is up to the challenge. it is surely the best thing in its genre  and possibly  many will feel  of any genre. the bar has been raised  and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.  half-life 2 is out now for the pc,-2.1703062
1087,business,us interest rates increased to 2% us interest rates are to rise for the fourth time in five months  in a widely anticipated move.  the federal reserve has raised its key federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 2% in light of mounting evidence that the us economy is regaining steam. us companies created twice as many jobs as expected in october while exports hit record levels in september. analysts said a clear-cut victory for president bush in last week s election paved the way for a rise. another rise could be in store for december  some economists warned.  the fed s open market committee - which sets interest rate policy in the us - voted unanimously in favour of a quarter point rise. the fed has been gradually easing rates up since the summer  with quarter percentage point rises in june  august and september.  the central bank has been acting to restrain inflationary pressures while being careful not to obstruct economic growth. the fed did not rule out raising rates once again in december but noted that any future increases would take place at a  measured  pace. in a statement  the fed said that long-term inflation pressures remained  well contained  while the us economy appeared to be  growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices . financial analysts broadly welcomed the fed s move and shares traded largely flat. the dow jones industrial average closed down 0.89 points  or 0.01%  at 10 385.48.  recent evidence has pointed to an upturn in the us economy. us firms created 337 000 jobs last month  twice the amount expected  while exports reached record levels in september. the economy grew 3.7% in the third quarter  slower than forecast  but an improvement on the 3.3% growth seen in the second quarter. analysts claimed the fed s assessment of future economic growth was a positive one but stressed that the jury was still out on the prospect of a further rise in december.   let s wait until we see how growth and employment bear up under the fourth quarter s energy price drag before concluding that the fed has more work to do in 2005   said avery shenfeld  senior economist at cibc world markets.   i think the federal reserve does not want to rock the boat and is using a gradual approach in raising the interest rate   said sung won sohn  chief us economist for wells fargo bank.  the economy is doing a bit better right now but there are still some concerns about geopolitics  employment and the price of oil   he added. the further rise in us rates is unlikely to have a direct bearing on uk monetary policy. the bank of england (boe) has kept interest rates on hold at 4.75% for the past three months  leading some commentators to argue that rates may have peaked. in a report published on wednesday  the bank said that with rates at their current level  inflation would rise to its 2% target within two years. however  boe governor mervyn king warned only last month that the era of consistently low inflation and low unemployment may be coming to an end.,-0.4700613
1447,business,trial begins of spain s top banker the trial of emilio botin  the chairman of spain s most powerful bank  santander central hispano  has started in madrid.  mr botin is accused of misusing the bank s funds after he approved the payment of 160m euros ($208m; £111m) in bonus and pension payouts to two former executives. however  the trial was suspended when mr botin s lawyer introduced a new set of documents on the day testimony was set to begin. a three-judge panel gave prosecution lawyers until monday to study the documents  when the trial will be reconvened.  the high-profile case began after two santander shareholders filed a criminal complaint about the payments to jose maria amusategui and angel corcostegui  who stepped down in 2001. both executives helped mr botin orchestrate spain s biggest bank merger  between santander and banco central hispano  in 1999. as he arrived at spain s high court earlier on wednesday  mr botin greeted the waiting media  saying:  i have full faith in justice.  santander s board of governors strongly reject the charges against their chairman  saying the payouts were legal and made with their unanimous support. but if convicted  mr botin could face a prison term of up to six years. mr corcostegui  a former ceo at santander  also asked the court for new evidence to be admitted. in spite of the allegations against him  mr botin continues to lead santander  and was instrumental in the £8.5bn takeover last november of the british bank abbey national. since taking over the chairmanship in 1986  he has turned santander into one of the top ten biggest banks in the world.,-1.6606016
486,politics,kennedy looks to election gains they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics - the real opposition  the valid opposition  the effective opposition or the authentic opposition.  but the liberal democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they  not the tories  who are now the real threat to labour. as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign  the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a  fading  force. and he insisted there was  no limit  to his party s ambitions in the coming poll. and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things. sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test.  and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party s westminster hq. he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election.  the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow - as proved  he claimed  by the defection to labour of robert jackson - that only his party offered a genuine alternative. on the war on iraq  identity cards  student fees and the council tax  there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed  sensible alternatives. he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than £100 000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees  the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax. he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to  prop up  either of the other big parties after the election.  there was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self-delusion. that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats. the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats.  labour  in particular  fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats. but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that. he will not talk about the big breakthrough  although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold. they would argue that  by the time of the election after next  the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power. the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq. but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible  costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax  crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name.,2.38205
1837,politics,watchdog probes e-mail deletions the information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of cabinet office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.  richard thomas  totally condemned  the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 january. government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served  no current purpose   mr thomas said. the tories and the lib dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.  tory leader michael howard has written to tony blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. on monday lib dem constitutional affairs committee chairman alan beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the hutton inquiry. the timing of the new rules just before the freedom of information act comes into forces was  too unlikely to have been a coincidence   mr beith said. but a cabinet office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or  the destruction of important records . mr beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the  e-mail regime  could  support the freedom of information regime .  mr thomas said:  the new act of parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.  he said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. all e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws  but the important thing was the content of the e-mail  said mr thomas.   if in doubt retain  that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. it s only when you ve got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it.  but any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.  the freedom of information act will cover england  wales and northern ireland from next year. similar measures are being brought in at the same time in scotland. it provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100 000 public bodies  subject to various exemptions. its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.,3.4427433

2035,sport,what now for kelly holmes  last april  kelly holmes spoke to the bbc sport website about her loneliness  her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the olympics.  it just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them. four months later  holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made a dame  won the bbc sport personality of the year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes. with so much time spent in the spotlight  holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt. and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead  the 34-year-old has repeatedly chosen to tick the  don t know  box. holmes has now pulled out of this weekend s european indoor championships  where she was selected for both the 800m and 1500m  because of a hamstring injury. but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore   well  it s a lot easier being the double olympic champion  being feted by everybody  than training to be at the top in middle distance running   points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram.  you have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you re very talented.   holmes  drive and determination have always been unquestionable - that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty-handed. but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself.  will i have as much commitment  desire and energy to go through a major championship   holmes asked in the new year.  that is what i don t know.  at 34  holmes will also be aware that time is running out. us 400m and 200m legend michael johnson  a five-time olympic gold medallist  retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did britain s double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson. the physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for holmes  who has already admitted she  doesn t like the training anymore.  whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double olympic champion will spur her opponents on. holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten. unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race  she will not step onto the track. but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer  there are more prizes up for grabs. the day after completing her double in athens  the 34-year-old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title.  holmes  wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled  such as a first gold at the world championships in helsinki. there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes  motivation - the realisation that no matter how hard she trains  nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens. on the other hand  if those achievements cannot be matched shouldn t they be at least shared and celebrated   you don t get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion   agreed cram.  you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it s a fantastic feeling.  i think deep down kelly wants to run. i think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain.   athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new-look kelly holmes tearing up the track again. after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire. so  why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where  when or whether to even bother competing again   that s just kelly   explains cram.  she s always been like that.  she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next. she knows every time she makes a pronouncement now it s headline news.  kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions  whether she can be competitive  if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line.  and if she decides not to run again  no-one is going to turn round and say  you re making the wrong decision.,0.3757639

1024,politics,labour attacked on howard poster labour has been accused of using anti-semitic images in posters which critics claim depict tory leader michael howard as fagin.  the poster shows mr howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch  saying:  i can spend the same money twice.  the image prompted concern from the editor of the jewish chronicle but labour insists it is simply anti-tory. labour later took the image off its website  saying an alternative idea had proved more popular with party members. the party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin with a blackboard reading:  2+2=5 .  the hypnotism poster has been compared to the portrayal of the dickens character fagin in the stage version of the musical oliver! there was controversy over another poster choice offered to labour members. it showed mr howard and mr letwin - who are both jewish - as flying pigs. mr howard did not comment on the anti-semitism claims when asked about the poster on monday. instead  he pointed to how tony blair had in 1997 complained about  personalised abusive campaigning . mr howard told greater manchester radio:  it is such a pity that mr blair doesn t practise what he preaches.   jewish chronicle editor ned temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e-mails from jewish chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image.  shylock and fagin are inextricably linked to notions of centuries-old prejudice   he told bbc radio 4 s world at one.  whatever the idea is  i think it s a difficult exercise to use images like that and to argue that you can divorce them from their historical context or meaning.  mr temko said he blamed  cock-up not conspiracy   saying he did not detect inherent anti-semitism in any of the parties  election campaigns.  the poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to labour members  who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. labour mp louise ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti-semitic when they only challenged tory economic policies. labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said the poster had been misunderstood. the image simply portrayed mr howard as a hypnotist  he argued.  concern has been expressed and clearly we have to take those views on board but i would emphasise that if you see the posters  the common theme... is that the tories are trying to con you.  a labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party s website was not affected by the row.  this has been up on the website for two weeks and there has only been a fuss in the last four days so a substantial number of people voted before there was any fuss   he said. but a conservative spokeswoman said:  this poster campaign - which was offensive to many people - was a big misjudgement by labour s campaign team.,0.11850643

639,business,asia shares defy post-quake gloom thailand has become the first of the 10 southern asian nations battered by giant waves at the weekend to cut its economic forecast.  thailand s economy is now expected to grow by 5.7% in 2005  rather than 6% as forecast before tsunamis hit six tourist provinces. the full economic costs of the disaster remain unclear. in part  this is because of its scale  and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. but indonesian  indian and hong kong stock markets reached record highs on wednesday  suggesting that investors do not fear a major economic impact.  the highs showed the gap in outlook between investors in large firms and individuals who have lost their livelihoods.  investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas - such as aceh in indonesia - were so under-developed that the tragedy would little impact on asia s listed companies  according to analysts.  obviously with a lot of loss of life  a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess  bury the people and find the missing. but it s not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense   said abn amro chief asian strategist eddie wong. india s bombay stock exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on wednesday. expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the indonesian stock exchange in jakarta to a record high on wednesday. in hong kong  the hang seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of south east asia. in sri lanka  some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. sri lanka s stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend  but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.  thailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months  according to tourism minister sontaya kunplome.  in the affected provinces  he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work.  it will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level   said naris chaiyasoot  director general at the ministry s fiscal policy office. in the maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth  according to a government spokesman.  our nation is in peril here   said ahmed shaheed  the chief government spokesman. he estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. the maldives has gross domestic product of $660m.  it won t be surprising if the cost exceeds our gdp   he said.  in the last few years  we made great progress in our standard of living - the united nations recognised this. now we see this can disappear in a few days  a few minutes.  shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged  and a similar number have suffered significant damage. however  many experts  including the world bank  have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact.,2.7943885

1035,politics,correction agency plans dropped plans to create a single correctional agency for scotland have been scrapped.  the scottish executive will not now merge the scottish prison service with local authority social work criminal justice departments. the national correctional agency would have provided a  one-stop  justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition. instead  scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending. the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison  preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending.  scotland s reoffending rate is high  with more than 60% of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail. this is leading to an ever-expanding prison population and the executive wants to tackle the problem. ministers thought merging the prison service with the council-controlled criminal justice social work departments  which provide community sentences  might have provided an answer. however  following a consultation on the idea  justice minister cathy jamieson has decided to drop the plans. instead  ms jamieson will change the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system.  she will announce the move in her criminal justice plan on monday  aiming to  break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community . the new measures will place a new statutory duty on the sps to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships. a national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise ms jamieson on the sps s role and performance in reducing reoffending. the minister said:  better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there.  communities who are paying the price for this reoffending - both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs - expect better.  it costs the taxpayer £35 000 a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing.  taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping those people in prison.  therefore  as we continue to invest in the service  it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves  to ministers and to parliament.,0.54565

235,business,consumer spending lifts us growth us economic growth accelerated in the third quarter  helped by strong consumer spending  official figures have shown.  the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.7% in the july to september period  the commerce department said. the figure marked an increase on the 3.3% growth recorded in the second quarter  but fell short of the 4.2% rate pencilled in by forecasters. the increase reflected the biggest jump in consumer spending in a year.  it was a little softer than the consensus  but not a real surprise   said gary thayer  an economist at ag edwards & sons. friday s growth estimate is one of the last significant pieces of economic data before the 2 november presidential election.  democrat challenger john kerry has criticised president george w bush s handling of the economy  pointing to a net loss of over 800 000 jobs since mr bush took office. analysts said the economy was still not growing fast enough to stimulate large-scale job creation.  it s a pretty good growth rate  but it may not be good enough to create enough jobs   said robert brusca  chief economist at fact and opinion economics in new york. however  president bush is expected to point to commerce department figures showing that consumer spending grew at 4.6% in the third quarter  up from just 1.6% in the second  as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth. consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the us.  the weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the us federal reserve will raise interest rates next month  economists said.  the economy regained some traction in the third quarter  but the growth is not robust   ag edwards  thayer.  i think that means the fed can take its time raising rates. we ll probably see one more rate hike before the end of the year.  in an effort to pre-empt rising inflation  the federal reserve has pushed through three quarter-point rate rises since june this year  taking borrowing costs to 1.75%. on the financial markets  the dollar fell slightly against the euro and the yen  while the dow jones index of leading us shares was little changed.,1.0904479

498,business,g7 backs africa debt relief plan g7 finance ministers have backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world s poorest countries.  uk chancellor gordon brown said the london meeting of the world s seven richest nations would be remembered as  the 100% debt relief summit . some 37 countries could benefit after a case-by-case review by bodies including the world bank and the imf  he said. but the us says it cannot support mr brown s international finance facility to boost aid to developing countries. bbc correspondents said the meeting had produced some movement towards the uk s ambitions  but much work was needed. mr brown said it was a major breakthrough for the international organisations to offer up to 100% multilateral debt relief -  the vast bulk  of money owed by the poorest countries.   we could be at the beginning of the final stage of the process where the debts that were owed by the poorest countries  built up over 20 or 30 years  debts that are simply unpayable in the real world  are finally taken care of   he said. he added:  it is the richest countries hearing the voices of the poor.  but he said they would insist on government reforms and the need for transparency  tackling corruption and openness from both the poorest and richest nations. bbc correspondent patrick bartlett said while it was an agreement in principle  the organisations involved now have to look at how it would work in practice. oxfam senior policy adviser max lawson welcomed the statement and said g7 ministers had  passed the first hurdle of 2005 .  but he added:  they need to move quickly to turn their proposals into real change for the world s poorest.  two million children will die needlessly between now and the next meeting in april. if rich countries are going to keep their promises to tackle obscene poverty they need deliver - and deliver quickly.  talks are continuing on how to finance increased overseas development assistance. the international monetary fund (imf) is to look at a proposal to use its gold supplies to help the debt relief effort when it meets in april. mr brown said g7 ministers had agreed to defer debt interest payments and repayments for some countries affected by the tsunami until the end of 2005. but uk plans for an international finance facility (iff) to help deal with debt in the developing world have not been agreed. mr brown wanted to provide $10bn (£5.38bn) a year over a decade  using g7 backing so the money could be borrowed up front on financial markets.  it is a key element of his proposals for a modern version of the marshall plan  which brought us aid to rebuild europe after world war ii  for the developing world. mr brown said it was  winning support every day  and said a programme had been agreed to draw up more details in time for the g8 summit in july. but us treasury under-secretary john taylor said the us could not support the iff because of its  legislative process .  the us is completely committed to poverty reduction and providing financing to do that   he said.  but this particular mechanism does not work for the united states. it works for other countries  and that is fine.  earlier  he told bbc radio 4 s today programme the us had increased support for africa in the past four years from $1.1bn per year to $4.6bn per year. but south africa finance minister trevor manuel told the bbc s talking point programme what was needed was one approach  with all wealthy nations on board. he said much of the money pledged by the us had not yet been dispensed.  the uk has made poverty in the poorest nations a key theme for its 2005 presidency of the group of eight (g8)  which comprises the g7 and russia. the g8 countries will meet at gleneagles in scotland. at a dinner on friday night  former south african president nelson mandela backed mr brown s plan when he urged the finance chiefs to write-off african debt and provide an extra $50bn (£26.69bn) a year in aid for the next decade. talks also centred on the impact of the rising economies of china and india  the us budget and trade deficits  how the us  europe and japan can act to boost global economic growth  and hiv/aids. g7 ministers called for more flexibility in international exchange rates and said  excess volatility  would impede economic growth. representatives from china  india  russia  south africa and brazil were invited to attend some of the sessions. a g8 summit is set to take place in july.,1.6015775

391,business,industrial revival hope for japan japanese industry is growing faster than expected  boosting hopes that the country s retreat back into recession is over.  industrial output rose 2.1% - adjusted for the time of year - in january from a month earlier. at the same time  retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 1997. the news sent tokyo shares to an eight-month high  as investors hoped for a recovery from the three quarters of contraction seen from april 2004 on. the nikkei 225 index ended the day up 0.7% at 11 740.60 points  with the yen strengthening 0.7% against the dollar to 104.53 yen. weaker exports  normally the engine for japan s economy in the face of weak domestic demand  had helped trigger a 0.1% contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking gdp. only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline. the output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic officials.  overall i see a low risk of the economy falling into serious recession   said bank of japan chief toshihiko fukui  despite warning that other indicators - such as the growth numbers - had been worrying.  within the overall industrial output figure  there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown. among the best-performing sectors were key overseas sales areas such as cars  chemicals and electronic goods. with us growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in early 2005 could also be one of sustained demand. electronics were also one of the keys to the improved domestic market  with products such as flat-screen tvs in high demand during january.,0.21007633
1795,entertainment,us tv cuts nudity from bbc film a us tv network is editing bbc films  dirty war to avoid showing the front of a nude woman being scrubbed down after a fictional chemical attack.  it is not worth showing  non-essential  nude scenes when indecency complaints are  aggressively pursued  by us tv watchdogs  said pbs  jacoba atlas. dirty war - screened uncut on bbc one last september - depicts a dirty bomb attack on the city of london. it is also being screened uncut on us cable channel hbo on 24 january. pbs said it will use extra footage for its broadcast  showing the woman  from a more discreet angle  instead.  the us federal communications commission fined cbs $550 000 (£306 814) last autumn for singer janet jackson s  wardrobe malfunction   during which her breast was exposed during a dance routine with justin timberlake. many us networks and broadcasters are now more nervous about airing nudity  violence or bad language. ms atlas said pbs could put itself financially at risk if it showed the uncut version of dirty war  and it could also deter many of its 170 individual stations from airing  an important film .  you want to pick your battles   she said. she added that pbs  which is a private  non-profit media enterprise owned and operated by the nation s 349 public television stations  is bolder about screening non-fiction or historical programming. pbs is seen in virtually all us homes with tv  and describes itself as a  trusted community resource  serving nearly 100 million people each week.,-3.8131008
73,sport,funding cut hits wales students the wales students rugby side has become a casualty of the welsh rugby union s reorganisation at youth level.  an amalgamated under-18 side formed from separate schools and national youth teams plays its first match on thursday  against italy at the gnoll. but that move has seen the wru decide to end its funding of representative sides such as wales students. as a result  traditional international fixtures against england and france in the new year have been cancelled. the welsh students rugby football union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches. the secretary of the welsh students rugby football union  reverend eldon phillips  said:  it is a shame that fixtures cannot be maintained this year.  the competition provided by the strong english and french teams has enabled the welsh students to test themselves in high quality matches.  the increasing number of young rugby players entering higher education look for the biggest challenge  that is representative rugby  but this year that opportunity will be denied them. players who have played for wales students before going on to win full senior representative honours include robert jones  rob howley  jon humphreys  darren morris  martyn williams and ceri sweeney.,-3.2631178
1285,politics,police probe bnp mosque leaflet police are investigating a british national party leaflet posted to homes in south wales opposing plans for a new mosque.  anti-racism campaigners in swansea have handed copies to south wales police. swansea s muslim community is raising money to open a new mosque and community centre in the former st andrews united reform church. the building on george street has been derelict since the 1980s.  taha idris  director of the swansea bay race equality council  said his organisation contacted police after receiving complaints from the public.  i m quite shocked to see this sort of leaflet by the bnp in swansea   he said.   the bnp has tried in the past to get into swansea and this is another example of them trying again.  i am in no doubt that the bnp are not needed and not wanted here.  a south wales police spokeswoman confirmed that they were looking at the contents of the leaflet. according to the bnp s website  they have been posted to homes in the castle ward. the bnp website carries a photograph of party leader nick griffin - who lives near welshpool  mid wales - delivering the leaflet. the bnp has denied it is trying to stir up hatred of any race or religion  but argues that they should be able to debate this without fear of arrest. swansea unite against fascism (uaf) is meeting this week to plan a campaign. following the death earlier this year of kalan kawa karim  an iraqi kurd living in swansea  it organised an anti-racism march in the city that was supported by more than 1 000 people. it is planning its own mail shot campaign and may launch a petition in support of the plans for the mosque.  andy richards  of swansea uaf  said the leaflet was exactly what he had come to expect from the bnp.   the people of swansea will not put up with this.  swansea s muslim community bought the former church  just across the road from the existing mosque on st helen s road  in the late 1990s. mr idris said the community was now raising money to renovate the building.  it is a landmark building in swansea and would otherwise just crumble   he said.  it is the ideal opportunity for the building to be restored and used in the proper manner.  it will be a muslim community centre. it s a holistic place used for education  weddings  deaths and births.  he said space was limited in the current mosque and on some occasions muslims had to travel to llanelli for cultural events.,0.39865303
362,business,japanese growth grinds to a halt growth in japan evaporated in the three months to september  sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough.  output in the period grew just 0.1%  an annual rate of 0.3%. exports - the usual engine of recovery - faltered  while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short. the growth falls well short of expectations  but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion.  the economy had stagnated throughout the 1990s  experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums. one result was deflation - prices falling rather than rising - which made japanese shoppers cautious and kept them from spending.  the effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery. but high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the growth rate  while the falling dollar means products shipped to the us are becoming relatively more expensive.  the performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year. the first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%  with the second showing 1.1%  and economists had been predicting as much as 2% this time around.  exports slowed while capital spending became weaker   said hiromichi shirakawa  chief economist at ubs securities in tokyo.  personal consumption looks good  but it was mainly due to temporary factors such as the olympics.  the amber light is flashing.  the government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes  a policy it will have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with japan s massive public debt.,-0.20171547
2020,business,ad sales boost time warner profit quarterly profits at us media giant timewarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (£600m) for the three months to december  from $639m year-earlier.  the firm  which is now one of the biggest investors in google  benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales. timewarner said fourth quarter sales rose 2% to $11.1bn from $10.9bn. its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at warner bros  and less users for aol.  time warner said on friday that it now owns 8% of search-engine google. but its own internet business  aol  had has mixed fortunes. it lost 464 000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters. however  the company said aol s underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues. it hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to timewarner internet customers and will try to sign up aol s existing customers for high-speed broadband. timewarner also has to restate 2000 and 2003 results following a probe by the us securities exchange commission (sec)  which is close to concluding.  time warner s fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts  expectations. but its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m  helped by box-office flops alexander and catwoman  a sharp contrast to year-earlier  when the third and final film in the lord of the rings trilogy boosted results. for the full-year  timewarner posted a profit of $3.36bn  up 27% from its 2003 performance  while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn.  our financial performance was strong  meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility   chairman and chief executive richard parsons said. for 2005  timewarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%  and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.  timewarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into aol by us market regulators. it has already offered to pay $300m to settle charges  in a deal that is under review by the sec. the company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves  which it previously set at $500m. it intends to adjust the way it accounts for a deal with german music publisher bertelsmann s purchase of a stake in aol europe  which it had reported as advertising revenue. it will now book the sale of its stake in aol europe as a loss on the value of that stake.,1.4219677

209,sport,aragones angered by racism fine spain coach luis aragones is furious after being fined by the spanish football federation for his comments about thierry henry.  the 66-year-old criticised his 3000 euros (£2 060) punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty.  i am not guilty  nor do i accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport   he said.  i m not a racist and i ve never lacked sporting decorum. i ve never done that and i have medals for sporting merit.  aragones was handed the fine on tuesday after making racist remarks about henry to arsenal team-mate and spanish international jose reyes last october.  the spanish football federation at first declined to take action against aragones  but was then requested to do so by spain s anti-violence commission. the fine was far less than the expected amount of about £22 000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence. arsenal boss arsene wenger  who was fined £15 000 in december for accusing manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy of cheating  believes that aragones  punishment was too lenient.  you compare his fine and my fine  and if you consider his was for racist abuse  then you seem to get away with it more in spain than you should   wenger said.  he shouldn t have said what he said  and how much money is enough  i don t know but it doesn t look a big punishment.  however  aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair.  i have been treated like islero (the bull that killed famous bullfighter manolete)   said aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions.  i have not liked one thing about this whole affair and i do not agree with the sanction. they have looked for a scapegoat.  spain s anti-violence commission must now ratify the spanish fa s decision and has until next week to announce its verdict. aragones has 10 days to appeal  and the commission can also appeal. alberto flores  president of the spanish fa s disciplinary committee  said no-one in the committee felt aragones was a racist nor had  acted in a racist way.   a fine  the highest we could apply  is sufficient punishment. suspension would have been a bit exaggerated   flores told sports daily marca.,-0.7245941

701,tech,peer-to-peer nets  here to stay  peer-to-peer (p2p) networks are here to stay  and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms  says a panel of industry experts.  once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year  firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology. the expert panel probed the future of p2p at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january. the first convictions for p2p piracy were handed out in the us in january. william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music  movies and software. since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down  the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology  blaming it for falling sales and piracy. but that is going to change very soon  according to the panel.  the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks. but they have slowly realised that p2p is a good way to distribute content  said travis kalanick  founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh  and soon they are all going to want a slice of it. they are just waiting to come up with  business models  that work for them  which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards.  but  until the legal actions are resolved  experimentation with p2p cannot not happen  said michael weiss  president of streamcast networks. remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out  mr weiss said:  old media always tries to stop new media.  when they can t stop it  they try to control it. then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money.  once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology  the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business. in august 2004  the san francisco-based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast  two file-sharing networks. the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the 1980s vcr battle  and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal.  p2p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files. instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients. there are now many different types of p2p systems than work in different ways. p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file  like photos  free software  licensed music and any other digital content. the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology. it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them. the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control. but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many. the global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month  and about half a million films are downloaded a day. legal music download services  like apple itunes  napster  have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content. sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004  with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months  the ifpi reported this week. but such download services are very different from p2p networks  not least because of the financial aspect.  there are several money-spinning models that could turn p2p into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies. paid-for-pass-along  in which firms receive money each time a file is shared  along with various drm solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered.  we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p   said marc morgenstern  vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer.   consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together   agreed mr morgenstern. but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry s potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations. unsigned bands  for example  use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively  which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign.  increasingly  what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content   said derek broes  from microsoft.  they will probably pay an increasing role in helping p2p spread   he said. looking into p2p s future  file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks  as far as mr broes is concerned.  once some of these issues are resolved  you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content  but also in ways that are unimaginable now   he said.  file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg.,1.4519022
279,sport,paris promise raises welsh hopes has there been a better six nations match than saturday s epic in paris   and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since 1978  those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris. welsh legend mervyn davies  a member of two of three grand slam-winning sides of the 1970s  hailed it as  one of the great performances of the past three decades . martyn williams  wales  two-try scorer on the day  called it  one of the most surreal games i have ever played in . a crestfallen france coach  bernard laporte  simply observed:  there was a french half and there was a welsh half . and what a half it was for the red dragonhood  transforming a 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period. but while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure  the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this welsh side. that they recovered from a battering in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time  then reverse it on the resumption  was remarkable enough. but in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in a nail-biting final five minutes  wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve.  in international rugby  any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day  but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis. england suffered some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory  the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered. wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light. but the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline. ten of the 22 on duty on saturday were also involved when wales were trounced 33-5 in paris two years ago. but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the 2003 world cup  wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place.   the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class   noted coach mike ruddock. the likes of michael owen  gethin jenkins  dwayne peel and gavin henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer s lions tour to new zealand. and players like stephen jones  martyn williams  shane williams and gareth thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve. jones  after his superb man-of-the-match display  observed that  we are a very happy camp now . ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that  ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad. the  joie de vivre  so evident in that magical second-half spell in paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s.  if england had half the innate attacking exuberance wales have produced in this championship  they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats. similarly  wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches  and that forward power  mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure are equally important. so on to murrayfield  where wales have not won on their last three visits. while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive  the players will set about the task of beating scotland. only then - with the visit of ireland to finish - can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s  and writing their own names into welsh legend.,-0.5852723
1824,politics,howard and blair tax pledge clash tony blair has said voters will have to wait for labour s manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax.  the premier was responding to a challenge from tory leader michael howard who said labour would raise taxes in its post-election budget. mr blair derided tory claims they could cut £35bn in  wasteful spending  saying the party had got its sums wrong. the two political leaders clashed just days after the opening salvoes of the pre-election period. mr howard told mps that  every independent expert  from the international monetary fund to the institute of fiscal studies had suggested the  government was spending more than it is raising and a labour chancellor would have to put up taxes . mr blair replied:  i think they are wrong for this very simple reason: that the treasury forecasts on the economy have been proven right.  the tories on monday highlighted their plans for tax cuts worth £4bn  although the specific taxes to be cut have not been announced.  they also spelled out their plans for reduced government borrowing and more spending on key services. labour and the liberal democrats have said the party s sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. but mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes. the liberal democrats have also launched their pre-election platform  with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the  authentic opposition   particularly on the iraq war  council tax and university tuition fees. labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing a  fraudulent prospectus .,3.1530318
889,tech,mobiles rack up 20 years of use mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend.  britain s first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise. in the 20 years since that day  mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of britons own a handset. mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline.  the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. the first call was made from st katherine s dock to vodafone s head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house. for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk. then on 10 january cellnet (now o2) launched its service. mike caudwell  spokesman for vodafone  said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase  cost about £2 000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.   despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s   he said.  they became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk.  this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on. he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million.  it s very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people   he said.  cellnet was forecasting half that.  now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone. cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one (now t-mobile) was launched. orange had its uk launch in 1994. both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology. the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired. called global system for mobiles (gsm) this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls. mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things  such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.,4.043662

1171,business,euronext  poised to make lse bid  pan-european group euronext is poised to launch a bid for the london stock exchange  uk media reports say.  last week  the lse rejected a takeover proposal from german rival deutsche boerse - the 530 pence-a-share offer valued the exchange at about £1.35bn. the lse  which saw its shares rise 25%  said the bid undervalued the business. euronext - formed after the brussels  paris and amsterdam exchanges merged - is reportedly working with three investment banks on a possible offer. the lse  europe s biggest stock market  is a key prize  listing stocks with a total capitalisation of £1.4 trillion.  euronext already has a presence in london due to its 2001 acquisition of london-based options and futures exchange liffe. trades on the lse are cleared via clearnet  in which euronext has a quarter stake.  euronext  which also operates an exchange in lisbon  last week appointed ubs and abn amro as additional advisors. it is also working with morgan stanley. despite the rejection of the deutsche boerse bid last week  werner seifert  chief executive of the frankfurt-based exchange  may well come back with an improved offer. it has long wanted to link up with london  and the two tried and failed to seal a merger in 2000. responding to the lse s rebuff  deutsche boerse - whose market capitalisation is more than £3bn - said it believed it could show its proposal offered benefits  and that it still hoped to make a cash bid.  last week the lse said not only was the bid undervalued  but that it had  been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented . however  it has indicated it is open for further talks. meanwhile  german magazine der spiegel said part of mr seifert s negotiations with the lse were about where to base the future board of any merged exchange. while mr seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of london  the mayor of frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost german jobs. many analysts believe german boerse has more financial firepower than euronext if it came to a bidding war.,2.0232723

983,business,india seeks to boost construction india has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in its construction sector.  kamal nath  commerce and industry minister  announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting. analysts say improving india s infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too. the indian government s decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector  according to some indian firms.  a spokesman for dlf builders  dr vancheshwar  told the bbc this will mean  better offerings  for consumers as well as builders. he said the firm will benefit from world class  strategic partnerships  design expertise and technology  while consumers will have better choice.   the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the  automatic route  in the construction sector  on projects including housing  hotels  resorts  hospitals and educational establishments. the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board  which can be bureaucratic. the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers  and benefit steel and brick-making industries.  mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired.  foreign investors can enter any construction development area  be it to build resorts  townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50 000 square meters (538 000 square feet) within a specific timeframe   said mr nath  without specifying the timeframe. previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area  discouraging some from entering the indian market. this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively  without developing it. anshuman magazine  managing director  of cb richard ellis - an international real estate company - told the bbc this was  a big positive step.   however  chittabrata majumdar  general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions (citu)  said allowing fdi in the country is compromising india s own  self reliance . he said   no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone.  mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.,0.49922943
624,tech,games enter the classroom video games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom.  with violent titles continuing to top the charts  gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn. recent research by the london institute of education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom.  games teach life skills such as decision making  problem solving   said martin owen  at futurelab. mr owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error.  futurelab is a non-profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning. most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but liverpool-based games firm lateral visions saw a gap in the market.  learning games were somewhat old-fashioned and we didn t see anyone else doing what we wanted to do   said dr carl gavin  managing director of lateral visions. the company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element. the result is racing academy  a massively multiplayer car racing game  which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well.  it is being used by futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom.  we are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game  we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational   said mr owen. players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach. the game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs  before and after racing. teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data  work collaboratively and review their own performances. this fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved  thinks mr owen.  the game has been trialled in two secondary schools in bristol and feedback from students has been positive.  pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other   said ben williamson  a researcher at futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools. dr gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers  need for learning outcomes and the children s desire to rise to a challenge.  games in the classroom need to support the teacher. it is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge   he said. professor angela macfarlane  based at bristol university  has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms.  use of games in schools has been patchy she found  with sim city proving the most popular. traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so-called edu-tainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun  she found in her research.  it is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies   she wrote in a paper entitled games and learning.  lite  versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles - persuading developers to write for the educational market. this would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing. already there are games on the market  such as civilisation and age of empire  that have educational elements said mr owen.  even in grand theft auto it is not just the violence that engages people   he said. it could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though.,-0.67216444
1051,politics,uk helps raped rwandan women britain is to give a £4m grant to help women survivors of the rwandan genocide who were raped and often deliberately infected with hiv/aids.  an estimated 25 000 girls and women were raped during the 1994 genocide. about 800 000 tutsis and moderate hutus were killed by hutu militias after the assassination of an ethnic hutu leader. the five-year department for international development funding will enable more survivors to have access to anti-retroviral treatment.  the plight of the infected women was overshadowed for a long time. it was overshadowed by rwanda s emergence from the 100 days of slaughter  during which time the mass killings took place  and the women s fate was largely a taboo subject. but many of the women were widowed and they now not only have their own children to care for but  in many cases  orphans too.  as the women die  the number of rwanda s orphans rises. until recently  very few of the women have had access to anti-retroviral treatment. that is now starting to change. this funding is intended to make anti-retrovirals and other care available for some 2 500 women. mary kayitesi blewitt  founder of the survivors fund (surf)  one of the organisations through which the funds are being channelled  said it was a recognition  before it was too late  that the survivors should be a priority for help.,-3.7180634
617,tech,rivals of the £400 apple... the mac mini is the cheapest apple computer ever. but though it is cheap for a mac how does it compare to pcs that cost about the same amount  dot.life tries to find out if you can you get more for your money if you stick with the beige box.      an extremely small computer that is designed to bring the macintosh to the masses.  apple offer a less powerful mac mini for £339 but the £399 models has a 1.4ghz power pc chip  80 gigabyte hard drive  combined cd burner/dvd player. it comes equipped with usb and firewire ports for peripheral connections  ethernet port for broadband  a port for standard video output and an audio/headphone jack.the machine comes with mac os x  the apple operating system  the software suite ilife  which includes itunes  iphoto  imovie  idvd and garageband.  a monitor  keyboard or mouse. there is also no built-in support for wireless technology or any speakers. the lack of a dvd burner is an omission in the age of backing-up important software. wireless and a dvd burner can be added at extra cost.  apple are targeting people who already have a main computer and want to upgrade - especially pc users who have used an apple ipod.  compact and stylish  the mac mini would not look out of place in any home. apple computers are famously user friendly and offer much better network security  which means fewer viruses. the package of software that comes with the machine is the best money can buy.  the mac mini is just a box. if you don t already have a monitor etc  adding them to the package sees the value for money begin to dwindle. macs don t offer the upgrade flexibility of a pc and the machine s specifications lack the horse power for tasks such as high-end video editing or games.   the mac mini puts the macintosh within the reach of everyone   an apple spokesman said.  it will bring more customers to the platform  especially pc users and owners.     an entry-level machine designed for basic home use.  a 2.6ghz intel celeron chip  40 gigabyte hard drive  256mb  combined cd burner/dvd player. it comes equipped with a 17 inch monitor  keyboard and mouse. the machine has 6 usb ports and an ethernet port for broadband connection. there s also a port for standard video output. the machine comes with windows xp home edition. it provides basic home tools such as a media player and word processor.  a dvd burner  or any wireless components built in. wireless and a dvd burner can be added at extra cost.  homes and small offices  including those looking to add a low cost second computer.  cost is the clear advantage. the dell provides enough power and software for basic gaming and internet surfing. it s easily upgradeable so a bigger hard drive  better sound and graphics cards can be added.  the dell is hardly stylish and the hard drive is on the small size for anyone wanting to store photos or a decent sized digital music collection.   this machine is for small businesses and for people who want a second computer for basic home use  perhaps in a kids bedroom   a spokesman for dell said.  i think we offer better value once you realise all the extras needed for the mac mini.     a desktop computer that pc pro magazine dubbed best performer in a group test of machines that cost only £399 (£469 including vat).  a good basic pc that  according to pc pro  has  superb upgrade potential . for your money you get a 1.8ghz amd sempron processor  512mb of ram  120gb hard drive  dvd writer  16-inch monitor  mouse  keyboard and windows xp2  much more than the basics. it cannot handle 3d graphics and has no firewire slots.  those on a limited budget who want a machine they can add to and improve as their cash allows.  it s cheap and has plenty of room to improve but that could end up making it expensive in the long run. it s a good basic workhorse.  it s not pretty and has a monitor rather than a flat-panel display. some of the upgrades offered by jal to the basic model are pricey. you might find that you want to chop and change quite quickly.  nick ross  deputy labs editor at pc pro  said the important point about buying a cheap and cheerful pc is the upgrade path. interest has switched from processor power to graphics and sound cards as that s what makes the difference in games.  even manufacturers are not going to be marketing machines as faster   he said   they ll emphasise the different features.     a computer built from bits you buy and put together yourself.  a surprisingly good pc sporting an amd athlon xp 2500 processor  512 megabytes ram  a graphics card with 128 ram on board plus tv out  a 40 gb hard drive  cd-writer and dvd player  windows xp home.  anything else. you re building it so you have to buy all the software you want to install and do your own trouble-shooting and tech support. building your own machine is easier than it used to be but you need to read specifications carefully to make sure all parts work together.  experienced and keen pc users. building your own pc  or upgrading the one you have  is a great way to improve your understanding of how it all works.  it s cheap  you can specify exactly what you want and you get the thrill of putting it together yourself. and a bigger thrill if everything works as it should.  once it s built you won t be able to do much with it until you start buying software for it. if it starts to go wrong it might take a lot of fixing. as gavin cox of the excellent buildyourown.org.uk website put it:  it will be tough to obtain/build a pc to ever be as compact and charming as the mac mini.    performance-wise  it s not  cutting edge  and is barely entry-level by today s market  but up against the mac mini  i believe it will hold its own and even pull a few more tricks   says gavin cox. the good news is that the machine is eminently expandable. by contrast  says mr cox  the mac mini is almost disposable.,1.6794269

357,business,market unfazed by aurora setback as the aurora limped back to its dock on 20 january  a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe.  the ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble. and its owner  p&o cruises - now part of the huge us carnival corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year s profits and a potential pr fiasco. no-one  however  seems to have told the stock markets. the warning of a five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world s biggest investment banks had upped its target for carnival s share price  from £35 to £36.20. other investors barely blinked  and by 1300 gmt carnival s shares in london were down a single penny  or 0.03%  at £32.26.  why the mismatch between the public perception and the market s response   the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time   says deutsche bank s simon champion.  it was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company - it was a long cruise  after all. but the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events.   despite its string of bad luck  he pointed out  aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet  the uk s p&o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003. and generally speaking  carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule.  carnival has an incredibly strong track record   mr champion.  similarly  analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. the hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. that should mitigate some of the pr risk  both for carnival and its main competitor  royal caribbean.  while not common  cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry   wrote analysts from citigroup smith barney in a note to clients on friday.  moreover  such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises.  after all  the aurora incident may be big news in the uk - but for carnival customers elsewhere it s unlikely to make too much of a splash.  assuming that citigroup is right  and demand stays solid  the structure of the industry also works in carnival s favour. in the wake of p&o princess s takeover by carnival  the business is now to a great extent a duopoly. given the expense of building  outfitting and running a cruise ship   slowing supply growth  is a certainty  said david anders at merrill lynch on thursday. in other words  if you do want a cruise  your options are limited. and with carnival remaining the market leader  it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated aurora in the future.,-1.6992707
1071,politics,tories plan migrant health checks non-european union citizens wanting to work in the uk will have to undergo tests for tuberculosis and hiv  under plans unveiled by the conservatives.  a positive test for tb would mean visa applications being turned down  while hiv would be dealt with case by case. leader michael howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the nhs. labour said many tests were already done. the lib dems warned both parties against  pandering to prejudice .  the proposals  which would be brought in if the conservatives won the general election  would not apply to people coming to the uk for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. mr howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in canada  new zealand and australia.  it s very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that britain enjoys   he told bbc radio 4 s today programme. government figures suggest tb in england has increased by 25% over the past 10 years.  nearly two thirds of people with tb are born abroad   said mr howard.   i don t think a responsible government can stand aside and do nothing in the face of this problem.  but mr howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants  claims. the proposals include:  - people coming to the uk from outside the eu for between six and 12 months from a  high incidence tb country  will have to undergo a chest x-ray.   - people coming to settle in the uk permanently from outside the eu will have to  demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health .   - they will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to  impose significant costs or demands  on the nhs.   - the tests will include a health check  chest x-rays for tb (except for children and pregnant women) and tests for hepatitis and hiv for over 16-year-olds. only the discovery of tb will mean people will be automatically denied a visa  other conditions will be dealt with on a  case by case basis .  there is already some screening in place. last year 185 000 people were tested for tb at heathrow and gatwick airports  only about 200 were found to be infected. and dr john moore-gillon  of the british lung foundation  said:  tb is not simply imported  we are seeing a rise in many sections of the uk-born population as well.  the government says the tories are  a bit late  to the issue. immigration minister des browne quoted its five-year plan for immigration and asylum  as saying:  we are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for tb in high-risk areas at the entry clearance stage.  those who are diagnosed would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the uk.  meanwhile mark oaten  liberal democrat home affairs spokesman  said:  this is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between labour and the conservatives.  michael howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing  and history proves it is a very dangerous one.  lisa power  head of policy at aids charity the terrence higgins trust said the policy was prejudice-based rather than evidence-based.  in fact  it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their eu status   she said.,3.4881802

1951,business,christmas sales worst since 1981 uk retail sales fell in december  failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst christmas since 1981.  retail sales dropped by 1% on the month in december  after a 0.6% rise in november  the office for national statistics (ons) said. the ons revised the annual 2004 rate of growth down from the 5.9% estimated in november to 3.2%. a number of retailers have already reported poor figures for december. clothing retailers and non-specialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth  according to the ons.  the last time retailers endured a tougher christmas was 23 years previously  when sales plunged 1.7%.  the ons echoed an earlier caution from bank of england governor mervyn king not to read too much into the poor december figures. some analysts put a positive gloss on the figures  pointing out that the non-seasonally-adjusted figures showed a performance comparable with 2003. the november-december jump last year was roughly comparable with recent averages  although some way below the serious booms seen in the 1990s. and figures for retail volume outperformed measures of actual spending  an indication that consumers are looking for bargains  and retailers are cutting their prices.  however  reports from some high street retailers highlight the weakness of the sector. morrisons  woolworths  house of fraser  marks & spencer and big food all said that the festive period was disappointing.  and a british retail consortium survey found that christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years. yet  other retailers - including hmv  monsoon  jessops  body shop and tesco - reported that festive sales were well up on last year. investec chief economist philip shaw said he did not expect the poor retail figures to have any immediate effect on interest rates.  the retail sales figures are very weak  but as bank of england governor mervyn king indicated last night  you don t really get an accurate impression of christmas trading until about easter   said mr shaw.  our view is the bank of england will keep its powder dry and wait to see the big picture.,-0.97555923

2191,business,iraqi voters turn to economic issues beyond the desperate security situation in iraq lies an economy in tatters.  a vicious cycle of unemployment  poor social services and poverty has been made worse by a lack of investment. so there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock.  first rule of law  then the economy   says radwan hadi  deputy managing director of aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy blackwatch petroleum services  which entered iraq in 2003. mr hadi s view about what the new government s priorities should be is shared by many iraqis. the economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of sunday s election  according to bristol university political scientist anne alexander  who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war iraq.  job creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the iraqi people s wish list. nobody knows exactly how many iraqis are out of work  but it is clear that the situation is dire.  estimates of iraq s unemployment rate vary  but we estimate it to be between 30-40%   the washington-based independent think-tank the brookings institution says in its iraq index. but some progress has been made  largely thanks to the country s oil revenues which have exceeded $22bn since june 2003.  iraq s infrastructure is on the mend  with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply  irrigation  telephone networks and the re-opening of hospitals. but serious problems remain and the growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters. one iraqi woman told ms alexander about her frustration as she watched tv adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from baghdad s pharmacies. observes mr hadi:  the economy at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer  the poor get poorer.  an indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where  in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people  19 private banks operate  only one of which is run in accordance with islamic banking principles. hopes are high for the future of finance  so foreign banks have been buying into the sector. national bank of kuwait has bought a majority stake in credit bank of iraq  the jordanian investment bank export & finance bank has bought 49% of national bank of iraq.  foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort. bechtel s efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting its bottom line while halliburton has enjoyed a wealth of military contracts. but the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work  observes ms alexander.  it is seen as a selling off of iraq s assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of iraqi businesses and iraqi workers   she says. consequently  the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100% foreign ownership of iraqi assets  she explains. in the west  it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal baathist regime used to look after the majority of iraq s citizens rather well in terms of job creation  social security and healthcare. opinion polls suggest that  people still want the state to take a leading role in providing these things   ms alexander says.  yet in some areas of the economy  investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed  insists mr hadi  an iraqi who left the country three decades ago.  i think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast   mr hadi says.  iraq s vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth.   many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act  yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way. but there are exceptions. mr hadi s blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future. blackwatch s baghdad-based affiliate falcon group has dozens of people working for it across the country in kirkuk and baghdad  and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues  mr hadi points out.  these guys are trying to work. the iraqi business people will do business at all times.  life goes on in iraq  the people take responsibility  they want to live normal lives.,-0.059705734

1207,entertainment,uk s national gallery in the pink the national gallery  home to some of the uk s greatest artworks  has seen a big jump in visitor numbers.  five million visitors made the london gallery - which houses treasures like raphael s madonna of the pinks - the uk s most visited museum in 2004. it recorded a 13.8% rise in numbers and was the country s second most visited tourist attraction  behind blackpool pleasure beach. charles saumarez smith  the gallery s director  said he was  delighted . he said the number of visitors through the doors had boosted figures to pre-11 september 2001 levels. mr saumarez smith added that the pedestrianisation of trafalgar square  where the gallery is located  and strong temporary collections throughout 2004 had led to the strong performance.   our 2004 exhibition programme of el greco  russian landscape in the age of tolstoy and raphael: from urbino to rome was particularly strong and exceeded all targets   he said.  the exceptional quality of the paintings in our permanent collection is also huge draw for the public.  the expectations of today s visitors are higher than ever and we have kept pace with their demands.  mr saumarez smith said he was confident the gallery could maintain the attendance.  with important exhibitions of the work of caravaggio  stubbs and rubens in place for 2005  i am confident that the gallery is set for another highly successful year   he added. the figures were prepared by the association of leading visitor attractions (alva).  it found that the figures had been boosted by an increase in europeans travelling to the uk on budget airlines. popular cultural tourist spots such as the tate modern and the natural history museum all recorded increases of more than 10% in visitor numbers compared with 2003. but for legal or confidentiality reasons some alva members did not submit figures for 2004  including buckingham palace  windsor castle  madame tussauds and alton towers. alva director robin broke said:  visits from western europe were up by 10% and from north america by some 9% compared to 2003  while numbers from the rest of the world rose 20%.  european figures were helped by the rapid growth of low-cost flights to britain from europe  especially from new eu countries.,-3.0964813
540,business,bank holds interest rate at 4.75% the bank of england has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%  in a widely-predicted move.  rates went up five times from november 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since august. recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending  as well as in mortgage approvals. and retail sales disappointed over christmas  with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.  rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers  optimism  causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods  according to a report earlier this week from the british retail consortium. the brc said britain s retailers had endured their worst christmas in a decade.   today s no change decision is correct   said david frost  director general of the british chambers of commerce (bcc).  but  if there are clear signs that the economy slows  the mpc should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates.  dismal reports from the retail trade about christmas sales are worrying  if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.   mr frost added:  the housing market outlook remains highly uncertain.  it is widely accepted that  if house prices start falling more sharply  the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.  cbi chief economist ian mccafferty said the economy had  slowed in recent months in response to rate rises  but that it was difficult to gauge from the christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer.  the bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures  driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices  against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity   he said.  interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.   on thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front  as the office for national (ons) statistics revealed british manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in november - for the fifth month in the past six. the ons said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in november  matching a similar unrevised fall in october and confounding economists  expectations of a 0.3% rise. manufacturers  organisation  the eef  said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. it also said there was evidence that manufacturers  confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.   so far the evidence suggests that last year s rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing   said eef chief economist  steve radley.  however  should the business outlook start to deteriorate  the bank should stand ready to cut rates.  some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year  although others feel the bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. the bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.,2.4368222
1987,politics,tories unveil quango blitz plans plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.  six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the tories say would save more than £4.3bn. among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities. tory frontbencher john redwood said britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive.  the plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies  such as boards tackling industrial development and housing. their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government. the tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people  rather than officials  run hospitals and surgeries.  announcing the plans  mr redwood said:  mr blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers  and has broken the pledges he made.  far from improving public services  spending taxpayers  money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats  more regulation and higher taxes.  his party leader  michael howard  argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending.  labour are creating two britains: the britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic britain   he said.  in the real world  people are working harder just to stand still. they ve seen their pensions knocked for six.  they re being squeezed by extra taxes. the forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic britain.   the government has announced plans to cut 100 000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive. but chief secretary to the treasury paul boateng attacked the tory plans.  the conservatives are committed to cutting labour s public spending plans by a massive £35 billion   he said.  cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting  bureaucracy  but would require massive cuts to front-line public services such as schools  hospitals and the police.  the liberal democrats have said they would cut the number of whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services.,3.6988692

2186,business,battered dollar hits another low the dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the us economy.  the greenback hit $1.3516 in thin new york trade  before rallying to $1.3509. the dollar has weakened sharply since september when it traded about $1.20  amid continuing worries over the levels of the us trade and budget deficits. meanwhile  france s finance minister has said the world faced  economic catastrophe  unless the us worked with europe and asia on currency controls. herve gaymard said he would seek action on the issue at the next meeting of g7 countries in february. ministers from european and asian governments have recently called on the us to strengthen the dollar  saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies.  it s absolutely essential that at the meeting of the g7 our american friends understand that we need coordinated management at the world level   said mr gaymard.  thursday s new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the us had fallen 12% in november - with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity.  commerce department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the us economy - grew just 0.2% last month. the figure was weaker than forecast - and fell short of the 0.8% rise in october. the official us policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters.  the us government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from  abnormal and dangerous heights  set in 2002. the us says it will let market forces determine the dollar s strength rather than intervene directly. statements from president bush in recent weeks highlighting his aim to cut the twin us deficits have prompted slight upturns in the currency. but while some observers said the quiet trade on thursday had exacerbated small moves in the market  most agree the underlying trend remains downwards. the dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further  albeit less dramatic weakening  in 2005.  i can see it finishing the year around $1.35 and we can see that it s going to be a steady track upward for the euro/dollar in 2005  finishing the year around $1.40   said adrian hughes  currency strategist with hsbc in london.,1.3339198

174,politics,mps to debate  euthanasia laws  mps are preparing to debate a bill which critics claim would legalise euthanasia  by the back door .  the bill would give legal force to  living wills   where people say they want medical treatment withheld if they become severely incapacitated. the mental capacity bill has broad support from charities who say it would give better safeguards over treatment. but christian groups say it could mean doctors withholding food and fluids even if they think it inappropriate.  ministers insist the mental capacity bill - for england and wales - would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life.  the bill would establish a legal presumption that everybody can make decisions about their own treatment unless proved otherwise. it would allow people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf  which could be challenged by doctors. critics fear it could allow  killing by omission  through withdrawing treatment. an amendment to the bill - specifically preventing decisions that would bring about death - has been tabled by former conservative leader iain duncan smith. ninety one mps have signed a petition backing the amendment. mps could vote on it later on tuesday  during the bill s report stage debate. the bill will then go to a third reading and be debated in the lords  before becoming law.  the christian medical fellowship (cmf) and lawyers  christian fellowship (lcf) said the mental capacity bill would allow euthanasia by the  back door . peter saunders of the cmf said it believed advance refusals should be only advisory  not legally binding.  cmf is concerned that patients will make unwise and hasty advance decisions to refuse food and fluids without being properly informed about the diagnosis and the expected course their illness will take   he said.  the lcf s andrea williams said there were  too many loopholes that could be abused by unscrupulous doctors . ex-labour minister frank field told bbc two s newsnight programme there was a danger people would feel under pressure to  do away  with themselves so relatives could inherit their assets.  constitutional affairs minister david lammy said laws affecting 750 000 people with dementia needed updating. mr lammy told bbc news labour mps would not get a free vote as the law was being strengthened  not changed.  we are against euthanasia  we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law   he said.  doctors are saying they want more clarity. patients are saying they want more clarity.  the making decisions alliance  which includes the alzheimer s society  age concern  mencap and the national autistic society  said misunderstandings over the bill had to be cleared up.  it will not change the current law on euthanasia and will actually provide a series of better safeguards when decisions are made for people who lack capacity   the alliance said in a statement. the british medical association also backs the bill  saying it just gives incapacitated people the same rights as others. debate on legalising euthanasia has intensified in the uk because of cases like that of motor neurone patient diane pretty. she died two years ago after losing a legal battle to allow her husband to help her commit suicide.,2.278633
1380,business,world leaders gather to face uncertainty more than 2 000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the swiss mountain resort davos for the annual world economic forum (wef). for five days  they will discuss issues ranging from china s economic power to iraq s future after this sunday s elections. uk prime minister tony blair and south african president thabo mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. unlike previous years  protests against the wef are expected to be muted. anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend.  the brazilian city of porto alegre will host the rival world social forum  timed to run in parallel with the wef s ritzier event in davos.  the organisers of the brazilian gathering  which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation  for fair trade  and many other causes  have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the swiss summit. however  many of the issues discussed in porto alegre are davos talking points as well.  global warming  features particularly high. wef participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event. davos itself is in deep frost. the snow is piled high across the mountain village  and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus 20c and less.  ultimately  the forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world s 500 largest companies scheduled to attend.  but much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to davos  not least because the agenda of this year s forum seems to lack an overarching theme.  taking responsibility for tough choices  is this year s official talking point  hinting at a welter of knotty problems. one thing seems sure  though: transatlantic disagreements over how to deal with iran  iraq and china are set to dominate discussions. pointedly  only one senior official from president bush s new administration is scheduled to attend. the us government may still make a conciliatory gesture  just as happened a year ago when vice president dick cheney made a surprise appearance in davos.  ukraine s new president  viktor yushchenko  is to speak  just days after his inauguration  an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power.  the european union s top leaders  among them german chancellor gerhard schroeder and european commission president manuel barosso  will be here too. mr blair will formally open the proceedings  although his speech will be pre-empted by french president jacques chirac  who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured a slot for a  special message  two hours before mr blair speaks. the organisers also hope that the new palestinian leader  mahmoud abbas  will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event  a list that includes shimon peres. davos fans still hark back to 1994  when talks between yassir arafat and mr peres came close to a peace deal. mr blair s appearance will be keenly watched too  as political observers in the uk claim it is a calculated snub against political rival chancellor gordon brown  who was supposed to lead the uk government delegation.  microsoft founder bill gates  the world s richest man and a regular at davos  will focus on campaigning for good causes  though business interests will not be wholly absent either. having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against aids and malaria  mr gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases. on tuesday  mr gates pledged $750m (£400m) of his own money to support the cause. mr gates  company  software giant microsoft  also hopes to use davos to shore up its defences against open source software like linux  which threaten microsoft s near monopoly on computer desktops. mr gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with brazil s president lula da silva. the brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from microsoft to linux. at davos  global problem solving and networking are never far apart.,0.9972544
1730,politics,guantanamo pair s passport ban the government has written to two of the british men freed from guantanamo bay telling them they will not be allowed passports.  a letter sent to martin mubanga said his british passport would not be issued in the light of evidence gathered against him by the us. this suggested he was likely to take part in action against uk or allied targets if he left britain  it said. an identical letter has been sent to feroz abbasi  the men s solicitor says.  it is not known whether the other two men released from the cuba detention camp in january - richard belmar and moazzam begg - have also received letters. the government is implementing the rarely used royal prerogative in order to withdraw the men s passports. it is only the 13th time the power has been used since 1947 - the last time was in 1976. the letter  from the home office  says:  i am writing to inform you that on the basis of the information which has come to light during your detention by the united states  the home secretary considered that there are strong grounds for believing that  on leaving the united kingdom  you would take part in activities against the united kingdom  or allied targets.   the home office said it could not comment on individual cases.  the liberal democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the us in order for the men to be allowed home from guantanamo bay.  home affairs spokesman mark oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture. he added:  the power should only be used in absolute extreme circumstances and i find it hard to believe that these conditions have been met this time.  he said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the royal prerogative. the liberal democrats have promised to raise the issue in parliament.  amnesty international uk also questioned whether the decisions had been based on  torture evidence  obtained at guantanamo bay.  furthermore  we believe there should be an investigation into the role played by the uk in the detention of uk residents and nationals and possibly many others at guantanamo bay   said director kate allen. the men s solicitor  louise christian  has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture. but the pentagon told bbc news us policy  condemns and prohibits  torture and said there was no evidence that any british detainee was tortured or abused. mr abbasi  23  from croydon  south london  was taken to guantanamo bay after being captured in afghanistan in 2001. mr mubanga  29  from north london  was originally detained in zambia.,-4.7354727
1611,sport,safin cool on wimbledon newly-crowned australian open champion marat safin has ruled out any chance of winning wimbledon in the future.  after losing in round one last year  safin said he had  given up  on wimbledon and winning his second grand slam title has not changed his mind.  i ll play  but with no expectations. i feel like i can t waste my time  my energy on that surface   he said.  some people  they cannot play on clay. some people  they cannot play on a hard court. me  i can t play on grass.  however  safin is hopeful that winning the australian open will give him the belief he needs to win more grand slam titles.  it s a relief for me. two grand slams  it s already something. but with this one i worked really hard for it   he said.  basically  i would love to win a couple more. i think i have a chance if i continue this way.   if (coach) peter lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for a bit longer  i think i can make it.  the 25-year-old shocked pete sampras in the 2000 us open final to win his first major title but then lost in two australian open finals. safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another grand slam.  i didn t expect that (to win the 2000 us open) - it was against sampras  i wasn t the favourite so i had no pressure whatsoever   he said.  after the first final that i didn t win against thomas johansson (in 2002)  i couldn t see myself winning the grand slams anymore.  i was once in the semi-finals of the french open  but i didn t believe i can win it.  i just couldn t handle the pressure. you need to believe in yourself  and i didn t.   and after losing the first set 6-1 to lleyton hewitt in sunday s final  safin said he began to doubt himself again.  i am 25. i m playing against hewitt. at least you have to have the opportunity to win it  at least have a chance   he said.  it s like you go there and you lose first set 6-1  then you start to think:  this is not my day. the way i m playing is ridiculous.   but then you start to really be a little bit more selfish and try to find a way out of there.  and i found it. i was like really much i was much happier than in 2000  that s for sure  because i get over it.,1.0418453
1895,business,parmalat to return to stockmarket parmalat  the italian dairy company which went bust after an accounting scandal  hopes to be back on the italian stock exchange in july.  the firm gained protection from creditors in 2003 after revealing debts of 14bn euros ($18.34bn; £9.6bn). this was eight times higher than it had previously stated. in a statement issued on wednesday night  parmalat finanziaria detailed administrators  latest plans for re-listing the shares of the group.  as part of the re-listing on the italian stock exchange  creditors  debts are expected to be converted into shares through two new share issues amounting to more than 2bn euros. the company s creditors will be asked to vote on the plan later this year. the plan is likely to give creditors of parmalat finanziaria shares worth about 5.7% of the debts they are owed. this is lower than the 11.3% creditors previously hoped to receive. creditors of parmalat  the main operating company  are likely to see the percentage of debt they receive fall from 7.3% to 6.9%.  several former top parmalat executives are under investigation for the fraud scandal. lawmakers said on wednesday night enrico bondi  the turnaround specialist appointed by the italian government as parmalat s chief executive  spoke positively about the company during a closed-door hearing of the chamber of deputies industry commission.  bondi supplied us with elements of positive results on the industrial positions and on the history of debt which will find a point of solution through the parmalat group s quotation on the market in july   italian news agency apcom quoted several lawmakers as saying in a statement.,0.092086315
1451,business,egypt to sell off state-owned bank the egyptian government is reportedly planning to privatise one of the country s big public banks.  an investment ministry official has told the reuters news agency that the bank of alexandria will be sold sometime in 2005. the move is seen as evidence of a new commitment by the government to reduce the size of public sector. the official said the government has not yet decided whether the sale will take the form of a public flotation.  the most important thing to decide now is the method - whether by selling shares to the public or to a strategic investor from abroad   he said.  analysts say the public-sector banks have suited the government s monetary  credit and exchange policies. nevertheless  the egyptian government has spoken for years about privatising one of the big four state banks - banque misr  national bank of egypt  banque du caire and bank of alexandria. it had been expected one of the smallest of the four big public banks - bank of alexandria or banque du caire - would be sold first. the announcement reinforces the hopes of investors and international financial bodies for a revival of egypt s privatisation programme. about 190 state-run companies and facilities were sold off from the early 1990s to 1997. the appointment of mahmoud mohieldin  a reform-minded technocrat  to the new post of investment minister in july was taken as a sign that more sell-offs were on the way. both the imf and world bank have urged egypt to remove obstacles to the development of the private sector which they say has a vital role to play in reducing poverty by expanding the economy.,1.2468529
888,entertainment,aaliyah claim dismissed by court late r&b star aaliyah s record company has failed in an attempt to sue the video producer who booked the ill-fated flight on which she died in 2001.  a new york appeals court has told blackground records that only the singer s parents had the right to launch a claim for wrongful death. the 22-year-old singer s family came to an undisclosed settlement over a negligence claim in 2003. aaliyah had completed a music video when the plane crashed in the bahamas. she and eight others were killed on the plane  which crashed as if left for florida. blackground records  lawyer frank penski said he had yet to examine the decision and did not know whether they would pursue the case.  an investigation into the crash revealed the twin-engined cessna was overloaded by 700 pounds (320kg). a post-mortem carried out on the remains of the pilot showed there was cocaine and alcohol in his body. aaliyah was a rising star in music and film before she was killed. she was honoured with a string of posthumous awards and her single more than a woman went to number one in the uk.,-2.3072085
1401,business,brazil plays down varig rescue the brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country s biggest airline.  brazil s airport authority chief carlos wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save varig  brazil s flagship airline. however  the country s vice president jose alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution. varig is struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of 6.5 billion reais ($2.3bn or £1.2bn). asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting of the country s congress to discuss the airline s crisis  mr alencar replied:  no  i don t think so. we will see.   earlier  mr wilson had said that president luiz inacio lula da silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week.  in practice  it will be an intervention  although this is not the technical name used   he said. an intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances. for that to happen varig s main shareholder  the non-profit ruben berta foundation which represents the airline s employees  would have to be removed  mr wilson said. however  no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying  he added. varig  which operates in 18 countries apart from brazil  has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country s economic downturn.  the depreciation of brazil s currency has had a direct impact on the airline s dollar debt as well as some of its costs. business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the brazilian economy. the airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government. on tuesday the courts awarded varig 2bn reais ($725m)  after ruling in favour of its compensation claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992. but the government can appeal the decision.,0.16252232
667,tech,dvd copy protection strengthened dvds will be harder to copy thanks to new anti-piracy measures devised by copy protection firm macrovision.  the pirated dvd market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago. macrovision says its new ripguard technology will thwart most  but not all  of the current dvd ripping (copying) programs used to pirate dvds.  ripguard is designed to... reduce dvd ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer   said the firm. macrovision said the new technology will work in  nearly all  current dvd players when applied to the discs  but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with ripguard. some bbc news website users have expressed concerns that the new technology will mean that dvds will not work on pcs running the operating system linux. the new technology will be welcomed by hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from dvd sales.  the film industry has stepped up efforts to fight dvd piracy in the last 12 months  taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of dvd movies for download.   ultimately  we see ripguard dvd... evolving beyond anti-piracy  and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions  interoperability in tomorrow s digital home  and the upcoming high-definition formats   said steve weinstein  executive vice president and general manager of macrovision s entertainment technologies group. macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against  rent  rip and return  - where people would rent a dvd  copy it and then return the original. ripguard is expected to be rolled out on dvds from the middle of 2005  the company said. the new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used  those programs will now most likely crash  the company said. macrovision has said that rip guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures.,0.42193985
1240,tech,gadget growth fuels eco concerns technology firms and gadget lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hi-tech products.  at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier this month  several hi-tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment. ebay also announced the rethink project bringing together intel  apple  and ibm among others to promote recycling. the us consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11% in 2005. but more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient  said the us environmental protection agency (epa). of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices  one of the fastest growing markets in technology. the consumer electronics association (cea) has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in 2005 will reach more than $125.73 billion (nearly £68 billion).  ebay s initiative pulls together major technology firms  environment groups  government agencies and ebay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them. the online auction house thinks that its already-established community of loyal users could be influential.  we really became aware of the e-waste issue and we saw that our 125 million users can be a powerful force for good   ebay s david stern told the bbc news website.   we saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand we have on the site for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment.  but it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment. teenagers get a new mobile every 11 months  adults every 18 months and a 15 million handsets are replaced in total each year. yet  only 15% are actually recycled. this year  a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile  according to a deloitte report. schemes in the us  like ripmobile  could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages. the initiative  which was also launched at ces  rewards 10 to 28-year-olds for returning unused phones.  this system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games   said seth heine from ripmobile.  one group of students collected 1 000 mobiles for recycling in just three months. mr heine told the bbc news website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes  learned behaviour . europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the us in terms of recycling awareness and robust  end of life  programmes  although there is a tide change happening in the rest of the world too. intel showcased some its motherboards and chips at ces which are entirely lead free.   there is more and more awareness on the consumer side  but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free   intel s allen wilson told the bbc news website.  there is still low-level awareness right now  but it is on the rise - the highest level of awareness is in europe.  a european union (eu) directive  weee (waste electronic and electrical equipment)  comes into effect in august. it puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them. but developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances. elements like chromium  lead  and cadmium - common in consumer electronics goods - will be prohibited in all products in the eu by 2006.  but it is not just about recycling either. the predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too. the biggest culprit  according to the epa  is the innocuous power adaptor  nicknamed  energy vampires . they provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones  pdas (personal digital assistants)  digital cameras  camcorders  and digital music players.  although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves  the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget. on 1 january  new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the european commission code of conduct. but at ces  the epa also unveiled new guidelines for its latest energy star initiative which targets external power adapters. these map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an energy star logo  meaning they are about 35% more efficient. the initiative is a global effort and more manufacturers  adaptors are being brought on board. most are made in china. about two billion are shipped global every year  and about three billion are in use in the us alone. the epa is already working with several companies which make more than 22% of power supplies on the market.  we are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat  hi-tech devices  but also bundle with it a hi-tech  efficient power supply   the epa s andrew fanara said. initiatives like this are critical; if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now  consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40% of electricity used in us homes  said the epa.,0.66834974
832,politics,tories pledge free sports lessons children would be offered two hours  free sports training a week by a future tory government  the party has said.  the club2school policy would provide up to £250m yearly for local sports clubs in the uk to deliver after-school sport. the extra coaching would be funded by the national lottery and would come on top of the two hours of sport a week children are supposed to get in school. shadow home secretary david davis said five million children were being denied adequate sporting opportunities.  the plans would help tackle the  fastest growing rate of obesity in the developed world   he said. shadow sports minister lord moynihan said the policy would empower local clubs and create a lasting legacy.  we aim to shift the emphasis on after-school sport provision away from our overstretched teachers and schools directly in to the 151 000 sports clubs in the uk.  the tories say labour s plans to give all children two hours of sports lessons a week in schools have failed. government figures show that in england in 2002 only a third of schools at key stages 1  3 and 4 and two-fifths of schools at key stage 2  met that target. the tories also claim that of the £750m the prime minister pledged in 2000 to invest on school sports facilities  only £41m had been spent. but the big lottery fund has said that complex capital projects are involved - and it was confident the money would all be allocated by next year as intended.,2.8759263
818,business,parmalat boasts doubled profits parmalat  the italian food group at the centre of one of europe s most painful corporate scandals  has reported a doubling in profit.  its pre-tax earnings in the fourth quarter were 77m euros (£53m; $100m)  up from 38m in the same period of 2003. less welcome was the news that the firm had been fined 11m euros for having violated takeover rules five years ago. the firm sought bankruptcy protection in december 2003 after disclosing a 4bn-euro hole in its accounts. overall  the company s debt is close to 12bn euros  and is falling only slowly. its brands  well-known in italy and overseas  have continued to perform strongly  however  and have barely lost revenue since the scandal broke.  but a crucial factor for the company s future is the legal unwinding of its intensely complex financial position. on tuesday  the company s administrator  turnaround expert enrico bondi  sued morgan stanley  its former banker  to return 136m euros relating to a 2003 bond deal. that brought to 49 the number of banks that mr bondi has sued  a mass of legal action that could bring in as much as 3bn euros. the company has also sued former auditors and financial advisors for damages. and criminal cases against the company s former management are proceeding separately.,1.5751667

1079,business,ore costs hit global steel firms shares in steel firms have dropped worldwide amid concerns that higher iron ore costs will hit profit growth.  shares in germany s thyssenkrupp  the uk s corus and france s arcleor fell while japan s nippon steel slid after it agreed to pay 72% more for iron ore. china s baoshan iron and steel co. said it was delaying a share sale because of weak market conditions  adding it would raise steel prices to offset ore costs. the threat of higher raw material costs also hit industries such as carmakers. france s peugeot warned that its profits may decline this year as a result of the higher steel  plastic and commodity prices.  steelmakers have been enjoying record profits as demand for steel has risen  driven by the booming economies of countries such as china and india. steel prices rose by 8% globally in january alone and by 24% in china.  the boom times are far from over  but analysts say that earnings growth may slow. the share price fall was initially triggered by news that two of the world s biggest iron ore suppliers had negotiated contracts at much-higher prices. miners rio tinto and cia. vale do rio dolce (cvrd) this week managed to boost by 72% the price of their iron ore  a key component of steel. analysts had expected japan s nippon to agree to a price rise of between 40% and 50%. steel analyst peter fish  director of sheffield-based consulting group meps  said the extent of cvrd s price rise was  uncharted territory   adding that the steel industry  hasn t seen an increase of this magnitude probably in 50 years . analysts now expect other iron ore producers  such as australia s bhp billiton  to seek annual price rises of up to 70%.  the news triggered the share price weakness.  it sparked worries that steel makers might not be able to increase product prices further [ to cover rising ore costs]  explained kazuhiro takahashi of daiwa securities smbc. in europe  arcelor shed 2.1% to 17.58 euros in paris  with thyssenkrupp dropping 1.7% to 16.87 euros. in london  corus fell 2.2% to 55.57 pence. japan s biggest steel company nippon steel lost 2.5% to 270 yen  with closest rival jfe holdings down 3.4%. china s baoshan  the country s largest steel producer  said that the uncertainty surrounding the industry has prompted it to pull its planned share sale. the firm had been expected to offer 22.5bn yuan ($2.7bn) worth of shares to investors. no date has been given for when the 5 billion shares will come to the market. baoshan stock climbed on news of the delay and its decision to increase the price of its steel by 10%.,0.65390205
218,politics,new rules tackle  sham weddings  new rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the uk are coming into force.  from tuesday  most non-eu citizens will need home office approval to marry. the home office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages  of which there are estimated to be up to 15 000 a year. but immigrants  group the joint council for the welfare of immigrants (jcwi) says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge. when the changes were unveiled last year  immigration minister des browne said:  our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages  while providing firm controls to prevent abuse.  under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the uk only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give 15 days notice of the wedding at the local register office.  but from tuesday all non-eu nationals  apart from citizens of switzerland  liechtenstein  iceland or norway  intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office  certificate of marriage approval . to get a certificate  costing £135  applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the uk. those without a settled status  such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application  will have no right to marry in the uk.  once they have the necessary documentation  those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in england or wales must register their intention to marry at one of 76 specially-designated register offices. they can  however  marry at the register office or church of their choice. rhian beynon of the jcwi said the new rules were  not proportionate  and  discriminatory .   these rules means in some cases the home secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort.  we re currently taking a legal opinion on this. we ll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we ll be looking at taking a case on this to the human rights court   ms beynon said. the new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights. in a report published last july the cross-party committee stated there was a  significant risk  the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were  disproportionate . the committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the human rights act on the grounds of religion  belief and nationality  the report added.  over the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions. in january 25 people who took part in a sham marriage network based in leicester were jailed for a total of 35 years. and last november samuel amoah  a belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the uk  was jailed for three years. several other cases are currently going through the courts. the role of registrars who under the asylum and immigration act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the home office  has been key in many prosecutions. registrars  spokesman  mark rimmer  said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent.  they will effectively remove most of the blatant cases. certainly those who are illegals in this country  of which we had quite a few  will no longer be getting married   mr rimmer said. mr rimmer  the service director for registrations of marriages at brent council in north-west london  said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties.  it may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it s still not as difficult to marry in the uk than it is to marry  for example  in holland  germany or france.  i think it s a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem   mr rimmer said.,-0.20081091
1981,business,minister hits out at yukos sale russia s renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed  a senior government figure has warned.  economy minister german gref told the kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was  unjustified . his comments follow the sale of much of oil giant yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm s assets into public ownership. on 28 december  another senior economic adviser called the sale  the swindle of the century . yuganskneftegaz  the unit which produced 60% of yukos  output  had been seized and sold in december for less than $10bn to a previously unknown firm called baikal.  baikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm rosneft  itself shortly to merge with state gas giant gazprom.  we used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing   andrei illarionov - then economic adviser to president vladimir putin - told a press conference.  now officials are doing it.  within days  he was stripped of most of his responsibilities.  mr gref  a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market  was keen to distance himself from mr iliaronov s comments. the privatisation of companies such as yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled  he said. but he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil.  i think that rosneft and yuganskneftegaz  should it become a state-owned company  must be privatized   he said.   today our government is ineffective and state companies  as a result  are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well.  and he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like yukos - a technique now being applied by the kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake.  if we follow that logic  we should nationalise all businesses   he said. many large russian companies  particularly in the energy sector  use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes.  mr gref also poured cold water on president putin s promises of doubled economic growth within a decade. the assault on yukos  assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months.  the task is not simply to double gdp; instead it is to use gdp to qualitatively improve people s lives   mr gref told kommersant.  we don t need simply to increase gdp  but to improve its structure.  instead of focusing on headline growth figures  russia needed to focus on better institutions  such as a more efficient - and less corrupt - court system.,1.2478352

1023,sport,radcliffe tackles marathon tasks paula radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the new york city marathon on sunday.  back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the athens olympics  where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10 000m. bbc sport examines the challenges facing radcliffe ahead of the big race.   the ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete s belief that they can do it. every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it   are you strong enough to finish    the question could hit radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. sports psychologist hugh richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence.  there is an old adage   get straight back on the horse that threw you    richards told bbc sport.  paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in athens.  she must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running.  if she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness.  she wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.    for much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in new york - win or lose. if radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. but if she fails to triumph  she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. and for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship  appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.   athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions   explains richards  who has worked with past olympians.  she must not get caught up in someone else s agenda.  radcliffe s best friend and fellow distance runner liz yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in new york.  she just thought   well  they can t think any worse of me now    yelling told bbc sport.  she s just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.    radcliffe described her decision to enter the new york marathon as  impulsive  but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but richards says she must avoid more emotional targets  such as redemption.  you can t change history   warned richards.  only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful.  paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.    the course from staten island to central park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. it is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit radcliffe better  with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs  final reserves.  radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the athens marathon.  it s suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again   said yelling  herself a marathon runner.  but that is only for long-term health and fitness.  when you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. so physically it is possible for paula.  richards also points out conditions in new york will be more conducive to a strong physical display from radcliffe.  the heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in athens   he said.  and that just isn t going to be there in new york  that s been taken out of the equation.      radcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in athens in time. and richards and yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage  starting in new york.  how you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not   argues richards.   one of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.  and yelling says:  i think this will probably make paula.   i think it will drive her on and she ll come out of it a better athlete.,1.0317311

2033,business,car giant hit by mercedes slump a slump in profitability at luxury car maker mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent daimlerchrysler.  the german-us carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros ($1bn) from 2.4bn euros in 2003. mercedes-benz s woes - its profits slid to just 20m euros - obscured a strong performance from the chrysler group whose returns met market expectations. mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from bmw and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006.  mercedes  profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003 s 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros. for the year as a whole  its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros. sales of mercedes  brands fell 2% as demand cooled  while revenues were affected by the weakness of the us dollar.  the carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its mercedes smart mini-car range. mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros  having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with german workers last year. the firm said it was determined to retain mercedes  position as the world s most successful luxury brand. however  daimlerchrysler s shares fell 1.5% on the news.  while all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround mercedes-benz   michael rabb  an analyst with bank sal oppenheim  told reuters.  in contrast  chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues - calculated in us dollars - rose 10%. the us division - whose marques include dodge and jeep - transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1.4bn euros profit last year.  overall  daimlerchrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4.7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros. chrysler s strong performance helped the world s fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros.   the year 2004 shows that our strategy works well - even in such a challenging competitive environment   said jurgen schrempp  daimlerchrysler s chairman. daimlerchrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture  japanese subsidiary fuso. daimlerchrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner mitsubishi motors which will see it buy out its stake in fuso. looking forward  daimerchrysler s profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005. however  it is expecting  significant improvements  in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the mercedes product range.,2.2364476

717,politics,child access laws shake-up parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers. curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied  lord falconer said. the constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on tuesday. he denied fathers  activists had forced the changes  telling the bbc  there is a recognition that something is wrong . between 15 000 and 20 000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year  although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.  lord falconer told bbc radio 4 s today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. but he opposed compulsory mediation  saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. other plans include:    - parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements  based on real-life examples that have worked in the past   - extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases   - better access to legal  emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet   - legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes.     judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a  nuclear option  which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child s interests  a spokesman said. the aim of the new legislation was to provide a  medium range  of penalties  such as fines  community service orders  compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews.  failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. on the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents  lord falconer said:  tagging may be going too far  but let s have a debate about that.  full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published  in the next two weeks   a spokesman said.  the government s proposals have met with disapproval from fathers  rights groups. john ison  from the controversial group fathers 4 justice  said:  it is very disappointing. what we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation.  jim parton  from families need fathers  said the new proposals  lacked compulsion .   we would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand  you know what the minimum access is.  otherwise  you see people make agreements which then fall apart.  mr parton said he had been told by children s minister margaret hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election  which is likely to take place in may.  the conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. theresa may  shadow secretary for the family  told bbc radio 4 s today programme that the government s plans were  inadequate  and were  papering over the cracks of the current system . she said a conservative government would bring a  radical reform  of the family courts  as well as enforcing a  legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation .  we want to make courts the last resort  rather than the first resort   she added. the government says children cannot simply be divided up  like property  when a marriage collapses. the liberal democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules  rather than having  rigid targets .,1.8215468

555,entertainment,the sound of music is coming home the original stage production of the sound of music is to be performed for the first time in the austrian capital  40 years after the film was released.  the first full-scale theatrical production of the musical will make its debut in vienna on saturday. julie andrews starred in the 1965 film version of the rogers and hammerstein classic set in the alpine country. but despite being one of the most successful musicals of all time  it is barely known inside austria.  the film was never shown in any cinema in austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s. the musical is based on the true story of the von trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from nazi-occupied austria in 1938.  sensitivities about nazism during wartime austria and issues towards the von trapp family themselves could explain austria s reluctance to embrace the musical. another source of irritation for austrians is the song edelweiss  which is considered an traditional folk song by many filmgoers. the song was actually an invention by rodgers and hammerstein. many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of austria  including yodelling  goat-herds and lederhosen. the production is being staged at a viennese opera house  the volksoper  beginning on saturday. maria  the novice nun who falls in love with baron von trapp  will be played by austro-australian actress and singer sandra pires.,-3.6783142

1767,sport,downing injury mars uefa victory middlesbrough boss steve mcclaren hopes that stewart downing did not seriously damage his hamstring during the 2-1 uefa cup win over graz ak.  the winger was carried off on a stretcher in the closing stages as boro booked their place in the last 16. mcclaren said:  stewart has tweaked a hamstring  which is a blow for us. we will assess it in the morning.  but i m delighted with the match result. they say in sport you can win ugly - and we certainly did.  mcclaren was relieved to make it through after a tough encounter at the riverside.   to be fair to graz  they had a gameplan - they knocked the ball forward  especially in the first half  and we struggled to deal with it.  in the second half we were better but it was frustrating because we got the goal - but one slip and they were back in it.  boro face sporting lisbon for a place in the quarter-finals after the portuguese side saw off feyenoord on thursday. and mcclaren added:  sporting are technically very good - portuguese sides always are.  but the journey goes on for us and we will now go to their magnificent stadium - after the first game here - we ll look forward to it.  goalscorer jimmy floyd hasselbaink added:  it wasn t a particularly beautiful match to watch - but they made it difficult for us.  we didn t play well at all. but you need a little bit of luck and i think we got that when my shot went through the legs of their goalkeeper.  i would have liked to play in holland - that would have been a little bit special to me.  but so is going back to portugal - i ll be playing against some lads i played with at boavista.,1.0130162
75,tech,tech helps disabled speed demons an organisation has been launched to encourage disabled people to get involved in all aspects of motorsport  which is now increasingly possible thanks to technological innovations.  the motorsport endeavour club left the starting grid yesterday at the autosport international 2005 show at birmingham s nec  with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display.  motorcycle racer  roy tansley  from derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated.  i needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg   mr tansley told the bbc news website.  in simple terms  i needed to invent a left foot - initially it was quite a heath robinson device.  mr tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing s governing body  the autocycle union.  at that time they wouldn t let any amputee race at all  but eventually they told me i could have a licence as long as i raced sidecars.  mr tansley s invention  the pro-shift  is designed to work with hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing. in addition to helping disabled riders to compete  mr tansley reckons that the pro-shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the isle of man tt. as a result  there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance.  i m not prejudiced  i ll sell to able-bodied people if i have to!  he joked.  another exhibit on the motorsport endeavour stand is a subaru impreza rally car  adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities. the vehicle belongs to pararallying  the world s only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in lincolnshire.   we use the latest technology supplied by an italian company   said rally driver dave hawkins who runs the company.  the cars have electronic throttles  electronic brakes  electronic clutches - we ve yet to turn anybody away.  mr hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees  quadriplegics  people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated. pararallying uses a vauxhall astra gsi with an automatic gearbox and manual subaru imprezas. the car on display is fitted with a  duck clutch  - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal. it also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar.  when joy rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father  murray  is a former australian formula 3 champion.  and it was rainey senior who modified a sports racer to accommodate his daughter s small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs. she uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals  a cushion behind her back and raising the seat.  but in a competition car you have to have everything right or you ll lose the balance of the car   she said.  i bring everything back to me - steering wheel  steering column  gear lever and pedals.  when she recently took part in the london to sydney marathon she shared the driving with her partner  trevor  who now does the engineering work. he designed a system for their morris minor so that the adaptations could be totally removed in under a minute. the motorsport endeavour club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level.,-2.208146

1464,business,bmw cash to fuel mini production less than four years after the new mini was launched  german car maker bmw has announced £100m of new investment.  some 200 new jobs are to be created at the oxford factory  including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. the result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200 000 cars from 2007. the rise  from 189 000 last year  is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. before wednesday s announcement  bmw had invested some £280m in mini production.  since its launch during summer 2001  the new mini has gone from strength to strength.  last year  almost one in six cars sold by the bmw group was a mini. the company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry.  our decision to produce a new mini was not received well right away   said norbert reithofer  a member of the bmw management board. initially  bmw said it would produce 100 000 mini models a year at its vast cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford  but the target was quickly reached  then raised  time and time again. not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue.  the risk is that after they ve invested massively in the brand  demand tapers off like it did with the new vw beetle   said brad wernle  from automotive news europe.  the price of the car has also gone up. when it was launched  the cheapest mini cost just more than £10 000. these days  buyers will have to fork out almost £11 500 to own a new mini one  or even more for the cooper s which costs up to £17 730. the mini convertible  which was launched last spring  costs up to £15 690 for the top model  and there is even a waiting list. second-hand minis are not cheap either. a mini one bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least £8 000 for the cheapest model  while a used cooper s is likely to be priced from £12 556  according to the-car buying website parker s. the consumers  association which operates with slightly different numbers  yet it confirms that the mini cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car  other than the mercedes benz c180 se and the bmw 1 series 116i se.  the cowley factory  which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100 000 minis  is increasingly being put to good use.  there are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. bmw s mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the uk car maker rover which it sold for £10 five years ago to the phoenix consortium. in 1999  when bmw still owned rover  the oxford factory was producing the award-winning rover 75. during that year  3 500 people produced 56 000 cars. last year  in the same factory  almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4 500 mini-workers. the mini factory s current output is equally impressive when compared with the main rover factory in longbridge  which in 1999 produced 180 000 rover cars. last year  mg rover  which employs more than 6 000 people  produced just 110 000 cars  though it hopes to land a deal with shanghai automotive industry corporation (saic) that could help double the number of cars produced at longbridge. indeed  mini is not only producing more cars than mg rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of land rovers and range rovers (which are made by the former rover unit that bmw sold to ford) are taken into account.,0.40567923

890,sport,wales win in rome wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in rome.  tries from jonathan thomas  tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second-half efforts from brent cockbain  shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory. fly-half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this year s tournament. starting full of confidence after their victory over england  the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half. his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short  the ball was switched left and michael owen s long cut-out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run-in.  stephen jones  who retained the kicking duties despite gavin henson s heroics against england  slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass  and italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.  henson  sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england  beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera  who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. with the welsh line-out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors  scrum  the home side s forward power brought them back into it. but a clever high kick from henson almost brought a try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.  wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute  henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his 15th test try. jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for italy. henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal  but wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.  henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to martyn williams  the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post  jones adding the conversion. italy  who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with a head knock before half-time  built up a head of steam on the resumption. de marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams  who beat several players with ease  and finished with a powerful angled run from lock cockbain. before italy could recover from that blow  a strong surge from gareth thomas and great off-loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over.  with jones converting both for a 33-8 lead  wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. the icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work  shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner. the only downside for wales was a hamstring injury suffered by luscombe. but after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years  they will travel to paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.  r de marigny; mirco bergamasco  w pozzebon  a masi  l nitoglia; l orquera  a troncon; a lo cicero  f ongaro  m castrogiovanni  s dellape  m bortolami (capt)  a persico  mauro bergamasco  s parisse.  g intoppa  s perugini  ca del fava  d dal maso  p griffen  m barbini  kp robertson.  g thomas (capt); h luscombe  t shanklin  g henson  s williams; s jones  d peel; g jenkins  m davies  a jones; b cockbain  r sidoli; j thomas  m williams  m owen.  r mcbryde  j yapp  i gough  r sowden-taylor  g cooper  c sweeney  k morgan.  andrew cole (australia).,1.156249

1208,politics,blair looks to election campaign tony blair s big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign.  that poll may still be about 16 weeks away  but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing. the prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto. there was a detailed account of the government s past record  with a major emphasis on the economy and public services. there was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with chancellor gordon brown. and there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly  new  labour - although that may continue to irritate his chancellor.  there was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges  although the prime minister talked about a  new labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society . his was more a speech designed to remind people  and some in his own party  precisely what new labour stood for  and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach. and  for some  that means showing that new labour actually does stand for something - that it is  as he said  more than  an electoral device .  to that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle england voters who switched to the party in 1997 and stuck with it  possibly through some gritted teeth  in 2001  and to more traditional lower income old labour supporters. in a key section  he declared:  in our third term we can achieve an unprecedented widening of opportunity and prosperity.  for the first time ever a whole generation growing up with unbroken economic stability. every family - not just the fortunate few - knowing their children will have an inheritance at adulthood.  every pupil in every secondary school guaranteed a place in university or a quality apprenticeship. every adult - including those who missed out at school - able to get the skills then need to advance.  home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it.  the highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions .  under what is to be the general election slogan  britain is working   the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly new labour. that might get under the skin of mr brown  but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful post-war chancellor britain has had. probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men  in so far as there is one  is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services.  an unremittingly  new  labour manifesto  as the prime minister is happy to make plain  will stress the importance of that - the belief patients and parents  for example  want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them. the chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance  although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle. with an election looming the next big speech from gordon brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and  in particular  the use of that little three letter word. but for now  all eyes have been focused on the next general election. and for many in westminster  mr blair s performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on 5 may.,0.42548323

1252,tech,blinx sequel purrs nicely the original blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to microsoft s then new xbox console.  its sharp graphics and novel gameplay  with the main character able to pause  slow  rewind and fast-forward time  were meant to lure many fans to the new machine. but poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half-way through a level without the required tools to finish. thankfully  the sequel has fixed many of the original faults. this time around you do not play as blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters.  the character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game.  as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions  pig and feline  assuming the role of your created characters. the thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing time crystal. as in the original  your feline persona can control time  but this time the pigs get to control space. there are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps  space bubbles and void traps in order to progress. the control over space and time is achieved through a number of vcr-style icons and is quite intuitive.  annoyingly  the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them. the game has also tried to emulate franchises such as jak and daxter and ratchet and clank on ps2 and so there are a number of combat elements. these are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair. but the game s excellent graphics  easily the best-looking platform game around  sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans.  blinx 2 is out on xbox now.,-1.3443832

16,politics,howard backs stem cell research michael howard has backed stem cell research  saying it is important people are not frightened of the future.  the controversial issue was a feature of the recent us presidential election  where george bush opposed extending it. but the tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of alzheimer s  parkinson s and motor neurone disease.  i believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses   he said. the use of embryonic stem cells in the uk is already allowed. stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body s tissue types. scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney  heart or even brain tissue.  mr howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research. but he argued:  we mustn t be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future.  politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind.  with the life expectancy of the average briton now around the mid-70s  society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people s lives as they grow older.  i know many people are concerned about stem-cell research. they are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls.  i respect those concerns. but i also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like parkinson s  multiple sclerosis  motor neurone disease  alzheimer s and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems.   mr howard acknowledged there were  no easy answers  over such an issue but it was necessary to  have the courage to do what we know to be morally right . he added:  of course  stem cells are still a recent discovery. more research needs to be done. but we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown-up way. the hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved.  former superman actor the late christopher reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident. mr howard made his remarks during a speech in westminster to the conservative national women s committee on ambitions and values.,0.42941952

556,sport,barbarians 19-47 new zealand new zealand proved too strong for an australian-dominated barbarians to round off their unbeaten northern hemisphere tour with an easy win.  rico gear ran in two of the all blacks  seven tries in what was a predominantly second-string line-up. the baa-baas did threaten  scoring tries through albert van den bergh  xavier rush and andrea lo cicero  but never looked like winning. all black aaron mauger was in good form with the boot  adding 10 points. the all blacks featured only two of the side which started last weekend s emphatic test victory over france in paris  while the baa-baas had nine wallabies in their starting line-up. and new zealand coach graham henry said:  it was a quality performance against a very experienced side and a number of young guys came through very well.  they learnt from the older players and this was a way of thanking the guys who had been mentoring them on the tour.  but the running rugby the crowd had been hoping for rarely materialised. marty holah got the all blacks onslaught under way with his fifth-minute try before rush hit back moments later. but new zealand went ahead once more as gear made use of the space vacated by a temporarily injured chris latham to slide in. ma a nonu then found his way through the barbarians defence to give his side a 19-7 half-time lead. the hosts failed to ignite in the second half and  the moment gear scored his second just after the interval  there was only ever going to be one winner. lo cicero  the sole european for the barbarians  bundled over for a try to briefly curtail the deficit. but the match was blighted by controversy moments later when justin marshall  was felled with a high tackle by jimmy cowan. referee andy turner waved play on and casey laulala coasted in for his side s fifth try. jermoe keino and piri weepu both added tries to the all blacks  tally before the final whistle  while van den bergh gained some consolation for the baa-baas. after the match  barbarians coach bob dwyer warned that south african flanker schalk burger needed a proper off-season break to maintain his standards. burger  21  was recently crowned player of the year by both his peers and the international rugby board  but has struggled for form in recent weeks.  it s his first year at that level and he was phenomenal up until the end of the southern hemisphere season.  i don t think he s played anywhere near that level on tour   he said.,-0.49586153

809,business,oil prices reach three-month low oil prices have fallen heavily for a second day  closing at three-month lows after news that us crude stocks have improved ahead of winter.  london brent crude closed at $40.15 on thursday - a drop of 5.1% - having dived below $40 a barrel for the first time since mid-september. us light crude traded in new york lost more than $2 to $43.25  its lowest close since 10 september. the price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days. the falls were triggered when the energy information administration (eia) said on wednesday that us crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago. the news calmed worries about winter shortages. weak us fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices.  it s amazing how quickly sentiment changed   said rick mueller  an analyst at energy security analysis. analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather  which has tempered demand for heating oil.  the stronger fuel inventories helped boost us stock markets to nine-month highs on wednesday  though only the nasdaq index had hung onto those gains by the end of thursday.  in london  the ftse 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4 751. the long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. however  traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in north america this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.  the price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004  but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late october. opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild us stocks hit by supply disruptions after hurricane ivan in september. traders were also encouraged by comments on wednesday from the energy minister of opec member algeria. chakib khelil said the cartel was likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week. however  some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden opec s attitude to over-production  leading to a scaling back of oil output.  fears still remain over the level of us heating oil stocks  which are rising but remain down on 2004 levels. a cold spell in north america would start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises. analysts  however  say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise.  mother nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks   said kyle cooper  at citigroup global markets.  long term i think we re headed to $30-35 but i don t think we re doing that yet. we have a lot of winter left.  john person  president of national futures advisory services  said the eia data indicated there should be adequate supplies for the next three months in the us. .,1.530092

1167,tech,movie body targets children s pcs the body that represents the us movie industry has released its latest tool in its campaign to clamp down on movie file-sharing  aimed at parents.  the movie association for america s (mpaa) free parent file scan software lets parents check their children s computers for peer-to-peer programs. it will also list all movie and music files they have on their hard drive. parents then have the choice to remove programs and files. the mpaa said files found would not be passed on to it.  our ultimate goal is to help consumers locate the resources and information they need to make appropriate decisions about using and trading illegal files   said dan glickman  mpaa chief.  many parents are concerned about what their children have downloaded and where they ve downloaded it from.   but some computer users who had tested the latest software reported on some technology sites that the program had identified windows default wav files as copyrighted material and wanted to delete them. movie piracy cost the industry £3.7bn ($7bn) in 2003  according to analysts. the mpaa said in a statement that it would continue to provide easy access to similar tools in the coming months to combat  the deleterious effects of peer-to-peer software  including such common problems as viruses  trojan horses and identity theft .  mr glickman said that the film industry was embracing  digital age technologies   like movielink and cinemanow  which are legal movie sites.  but legal services such as these need a chance to grow and thrive without having to compete against illegitimate operations that depend on stolen property to survive   he added. the industry body also said it had launched a second round of legal action against online movie-swappers across the us  but did not say how many were being sued. its first set of lawsuits were filed in november 2004. it also started a campaign against operators of bittorrent  edonkey and directconnect peer-to-peer networks. the first convictions for peer-to-peer piracy were handed out in the us in january. william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music  movies and software.,1.2855968
666,business,steady job growth continues in us the us created fewer jobs than expected in december  but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world s biggest economy.  according to labor department figures  157 000 new jobs were added last month. that took 2004 s total to 2.2 million  the best showing in five years. job creation was one of last year s main concerns for the us economy. while worries still remain  the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005  analysts said. the unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in december  and about 200 000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.   it was a respectable report   said michael moran  analyst at daiwa securities.   payroll growth in december was a little lighter than the consensus forecast  but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.   manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it s showing job growth  it s a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.  that means that the federal reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. the fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%  citing evidence the us economic recovery was becoming more robust.  job creation was one of last year s main concerns for the us economy  and proved to be a main topic of debate in the us presidential election. while demand for workers is far from booming  the conditions are set for steady growth.  overall  compared to the previous year it looks great  it just keeps going stronger and stronger and i expect that to be the case  in 2005  said kurt karl  economist at swiss re in new york. meanwhile  economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the federal reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in november. a fall in consumer spending  which makes up about two-thirds of all us economic activity  could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. but economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing  which include credit cards and personal loans  while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.,0.9755554

1999,sport,mcleish ready for criticism rangers manager alex mcleish accepts he is going to be criticised after their disastrous uefa cup exit at the hands of auxerre at ibrox on wednesday.  mcleish told bbc radio five live:  we were in pole position to get through to the next stage but we blew it  we absolutely blew it.  there s no use burying your head in the sand  we know we are going to get a lot of criticism.  we have to take it as we have done in the past and we must now bounce back.  mcleish admitted his team s defending was amateurish after watching them lose 2-0 to guy roux s french side.   i m very disappointed because we didn t give ourselves a chance  losing the first goal from our own corner. it was amateur   he added.  the early goal in the second half gave us a mountain to climb and we never created the same kind of chances as we did in the first half.  it s difficult to take positives from the game. we ve let the fans down.,1.3742905
137,tech,2d metal slug offers retro fun like some drill sergeant from the past  metal slug 3 is a wake-up call to today s gamers molly-coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings.  with its hand-animated sprites and 2d side-scrolling  this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago. but a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year. and yes  that includes halo 2. simply choose your grunt and wade through five 2d side-scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter. it is also the toughest game you are likely to play  as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on.  players must battle soldiers  snowmen  zombies  giant crabs and aliens  not to mention the huge  screen-filling bosses that guard each of the five levels.  the shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius. fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers  instead  to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware. tanks  jets and submarines can be commandeered  as well as cannon-toting camels  elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of iraq. doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls  and while this is a tough nut to crack  it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go. and at a mere £20  metal slug 3 is as cheap as sliced  fried spuds  as the man says. of course  most of you will ignore this  lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters. but at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation  metal slug 3 is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the xbox was not even a twinkle in bill gates  eye.,-2.2804875

59,business,us regulator to rule on pain drug us food and drug regulators will decide on friday whether to recommend the sale of painkillers that have been linked to a high risk of heart attack and stroke.  the food and drug administration (fda) advisory panel will give its verdict after hearing evidence for three days. the painkillers - called cox-2 inhibitors - are sold under brand names such as celebrex and vioxx. vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but merck said it would consider selling it if it gets fda approval. the fda has been asked to decide if the benefits to patients justify the increased risks.  putting vioxx back on the shelves is likely to boost profits at merck and make easier any legal battles with people who claim to have been injured by the drug  analysts said.  merck voluntarily stopped sales of vioxx on 30 september  a move which caused the firm s fourth-quarter earnings to slide to $1.1bn (£581m)  from $1.4bn a year earlier. merck s shares tumbled more than 10% on the news and the company has had to set aside millions of dollars to cover the cost of vioxx-related litigation. alarm bells were rung by a research note called approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least 18 months. the cox-2 inhibitors were developed by drug companies  including merck and pfizer  because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers.  pfizer is still selling its celebrex and bextra products  though investigations have suggested that they may also be harmful to the heart. merck s announcement of a possible reintroduction of vioxx caught analysts by surprise. merck s head of research peter kim said that it withdrew vioxx  based on the information that was available to us at the time  knowing there were alternative therapies . he went on to say that things have since changed in the light of new reports.  given this new information  its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in approve makes vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the us   mr kim explained.  on thursday  david graham from the fda s office of drug safety told the advisory panel that  there really doesn t appear to be a need for cox-2  inhibitors. according to calculations presented to the us senate by dr graham in november  vioxx may be linked to as many as to 56 000 american deaths. facing stem criticism for its handling of the vioxx case  the fda said on tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place. european regulators  meanwhile  ruled on thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take cox-2 inhibitors. the european medicines agency also said doctors should be  cautious  about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease.,1.4686499
1585,politics,abortion not a poll issue - blair tony blair does not believe abortion should be an election issue  arguing it is a matter for individual conscience.  the prime minister s spokesman set out mr blair s view after the top catholic in england and wales backed michael howard s stance on abortions. the tory leader supports a reduction in the legal limit from 24 weeks to 20 and has said current rules are  tantamount to abortion on demand . the prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to the change the law.  mr blair s spokesman said:  the catholic church has a well-known position on this issue and it was one of many issues the cardinal mentioned and therefore it should be seen in that context.  his words came as cardinal cormac murphy o connor  the archbishop of westminster  backed mr howard s stance and distanced himself from labour. in a statement  he said abortion was a  very key issue   saying:  the policy supported by mr howard is one that we would commend  on the way to a full abandonment of abortion.   cardinal o connor claimed labour had  developed  the notion that it was the natural party of catholics  but he said:  we are not going to suggest people support one particular party.  the family planning association says a reduction would particularly affect young women who often seek help later. more than 180 000 women in england and wales had terminations last year  of which fewer than 1% were carried out between 22 and 24 weeks.  in the cosmopolitan interview mr howard said:  i believe abortion should be available to everyone  but the law should be changed.  in the past i voted for a restriction to 22 weeks and i would be prepared to go down to 20.  all three main parties say the issue is one for each mp s conscience  rather than one where there is a party-wide policy. mr howard stressed his views were his personal views. shadow home secretary david davis said he understood mr howard had been signalling that a conservative government would allow a commons vote on the issue. mr blair and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy also gave their views during interviews  conducted as part of the magazine s  high heeled vote  campaign.  mr blair  who last year denied he planned to join his wife and four children in the catholic faith despite regularly taking communion  said abortion was a  difficult issue .  however much i dislike the idea of abortion  you should not criminalise a woman who  in very difficult circumstances  makes that choice.  obviously there is a time beyond which you can t have an abortion  and we have no plans to change that although the debate will continue.  mr kennedy said he had previously voted for a 22-week limit but medical advances mean  i don t know what i would do now . the roman catholic archbishop of cardiff  the most reverend peter smith  told bbc radio 4 s today programme that the church merely wanted people to  reflect on issues in light of the gospel  before voting. anne weyman  chief executive of the family planning association  asked:  what is the benefit to women  or to the potential child  of forcing a woman to have a baby   anti-abortion group the pro-life alliance  congratulated  mr howard on his new stance  but said it did not go far enough.,1.6214871

1991,politics,faith schools citizenship warning schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons - or social cohesion and democracy will suffer  says the education watchdog.  independent faith schools were singled out by ofsted chief  david bell  for not doing enough to promote the  wider tenets of british society . mr bell said muslim  jewish and evangelical christian schools must be  intolerant of intolerance . diversity  certainly must not mean segregated or separate   he said. mr bell s speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship - with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more.  badly-taught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by mr bell  and in a speech to the hansard society  he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy  public service and shared values. he highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools - which he said included about 100 muslim  100 evangelical christian and 50 jewish schools.  mr bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a  common heritage  and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion.  i worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools  with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to british society   said mr bell. the ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to muslim schools.  many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in england and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony.  mr bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were  tricky issues . but he argued that  we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation .  i would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as british citizens  equal under the law  should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance  illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community  be they women or people living in non-traditional relationships   said mr bell.,-1.0369935

813,business,us budget deficit to reach $368bn the us budget deficit is set to hit a worse-than-expected $368bn (£197bn) this year  officials said on tuesday.  the cost of military operations still needs to be factored in  with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further $100bn in the red. past congressional budget office (cbo) forecasts said there would be a $348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year. in recent months  the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits. in november  the gap between us exports and imports widened to more than $60bn  a record figure. the cbo says it envisages a further  orderly  decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away. but the non-partisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost us economic growth.  the budget deficit hit a record $412bn in the 12 months to 30 september 2004  after reaching $377bn in the previous fiscal year. the cbo also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015  an improvement on previous projections. however  analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential $2-$3.8 trillion costs of the president s plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts. the figure could also be worsened by any further military costs. republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the 11 september attacks and ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan. one of president george w bush s election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years. but democrats have accused the president of excluding iraq-related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit  a charge which the administration denies. on tuesday  the us administration asked congress for additional funds for military operations.,1.5877087
1799,politics,peace demo appeal rejected peace protestors have lost a landmark appeal over police actions in stopping an anti-war demonstration days after the start of the iraq war.  they had appealed against a high court decision that it was not unlawful for police to forcibly turn protestors away near raf fairford  glos  in 2003. the police had also sought to overturn a breach of human rights ruling arising from the same case. sitting on wednesday  three appeal court judges dismissed both appeals. they were challenging decisions by two judges in the high court in february this year. it followed action by police  when three coachloads of people were searched and detained on the way to raf fairford and forced to return to london under police escort. the demonstrators appealed against a finding by lord justice may and mr justice harrison that it was not unlawful for the police to turn the passengers away.  the police were urging lord chief justice and lord justices clarke and rix to overturn the ruling that they had breached the protestors  human rights by detaining them in the coaches. craig mackey  assistant chief constable of gloucestershire police  said:  we have always considered that our responses were proportionate and all our decisions on the day were based on intelligence.  he said no one on the coaches accepted responsibility for items found on the coaches including body armour  a smoke bomb and five shields.  given these circumstances  and the fact that raf fairford  and other military installations in the uk  had been the scene of increasingly destructive disorder in the weeks preceding this incident  the police commander on the ground made the decision to turn back the coaches.  from day one we have vigorously defended this decision  which was made out of a genuine concern that if the coaches were allowed to proceed it would have resulted in disorder and criminal damage at raf fairford.  fairford coach action  representing more than 80 people who appealed against the police actions  say they are prepared to take their case to the european court of human rights. their action is supported by amnesty international and liberty.,0.10679102

1628,politics,malik rejects all-black mp lists a call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and asian mps has been rejected by one of labour s most senior asians.  shahid malik  who is on labour s ruling nec  accepted people s frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities. just 13 of britain s 659 mps are from ethnic minority groups  he added. commission for racial equality chief trevor phillips argued on sunday the time had come for such shortlists. that came after it emerged that one of britain s most ethnically diverse constituency  west ham  was to get a women-only shortlist for the next election following an nec ruling.  mr phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups. for example in west ham  this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates.  if we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented  we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this  we cannot go on the same way   he said. he added:  it would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [west ham] in the whole of europe we didn t have a minority candidate.  appearing on bbc radio 4 s today programme  mr malik  who is himself running for the seat of dewsbury  acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates.  but he argued:  i do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they aren t doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective.  labour mp diane abbot  who backs mr phillips  proposal of shortlists  said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority mps - keith vaz  paul boateng and bernie grant - in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat. that was a rate of progress ms abbott described as  painful .  i am a little older than shahid and served on the national executive committee in the 1990s - i was the first black person on the nec ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and asian mp hasn t worked   she said.  the shortlist strategy works for women and i believe that it can be made to work for black and asian people.  on tuesday labour chairman ian mccartney said his party was  ambitious  to improve black and asian representation.  we haven t ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this   he said.,1.2604909
1515,business,booming markets shed few tears the market  former british government minister michael heseltine once said  has no morality.  and indeed  stock exchange traders around asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week s disaster. stock markets in indonesia and india have hit all-time highs this week; even in sri lanka  more comprehensively affected  the main index has lost only 5% since the waves hit. bigger markets further afield have barely twitched. the msci world share index  a measure of global stock market performance  hit its highest level this week since early 2001; the bbc global 30 has risen by 3% in the past week. and this at a time when - all sentiment aside - insurance costs are already estimated in the tens of billions of dollars  and countries around the region are looking at trimming their growth forecasts.  in fact  the markets are being perfectly rational.  for a start  the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines. the overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance: according to estimates from india  only one-quarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance  and only one-quarter of that group at most will have taken out policies. indonesia is likely to have even lower take-up rates. and where insurance certainly is in place - in  for example  the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market  rather than landing locally.  second  stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged. most of the biggest companies traded on the soaring jakarta stock exchange are in oil  technology and financial services - none of which have been hit by the flooding. tourist businesses  the most likely sufferers  are either foreign-owned or too small to have their shares listed. those that are listed have suffered: confifi hotel holdings  a small sri lankan tourism firm  has halved in value this week. but there are winners as well as losers. asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies  many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities. in indonesia  shares in state construction companies adhi karya and semen gresik have jumped sharply this week.  more broadly  the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact.  according to the natural hazards research and applications information center at colorado state university  there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by a depression. the need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity; there is rarely  the centre says  any sort of rebuilding boom  but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided. a study of the 1993 des moines floods  from the disaster research center at the university of delaware*  found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster  and another 18% felt themselves better off.  although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale  our research indicates that most businesses  even those that are especially hard-hit  do indeed recover   the authors concluded.  but disasters have a vast psychological impact  and markets are driven by psychological factors.  in particular  many analysts warn of panic spreading unchecked through the global financial system  as investors seek to cover themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unguessable events. in fact  again  the risks here are lower than they seem. even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $30 trillion and rising. a series of recent shocks  the colorado centre has argued  have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens: market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps  and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets. the trillion-dollar debts of japan s banks  for example  have had no effect on stock markets further afield than tokyo. and the us stock market was on its way down long before 11 september  2001; it rose by 20% during the six months following the attacks.  it is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings   one bombay trader said this week.  but the reaction would have been seen if business had been affected. business sense probably tends to overrule everything else.,1.9258533

1922,business,eu to probe alitalia  state aid  the european commission has officially launched an in-depth investigation into whether italian airline alitalia is receiving illegal state aid.  commission officials are to look at rome s provision of a 400m euro ($495m; £275m) loan to the carrier. both the italian government and alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid. the investigation could take up to 18 months. however  transport commissioner jacques barrot said he wanted it to be carried out as swiftly as possible.  the italian authorities have presented a serious industrial plan   said mr barot.  we now have to verify certain aspects to confirm that this plan contains no state aid. i would like our analysis to be completed swiftly.   the matter of possible state aid was brought to the commission s attention by eight of alitalia s rivals  including germany s lufthansa  british airways and spain s iberia. while alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability  the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition. alitalia lost 330m euros in 2003 as it struggled to get to grips with high costs  spiralling oil prices  competition from budget carriers and reduced demand. it plans to split into az fly and az services  which will handle air and ground services respectively. alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997. eu rules prevent that from happening again in what is known as the  one time  last time  rule for airlines. otherwise  eu regulations on state aid stipulate that governments may help companies financially  but only on the same terms as a commercial investor. the airline declined to comment on the commission decision.,0.6337328

2068,tech,online games play with politics after bubbling under for some time  online games broke through onto the political arena in 2004.  the us presidential election provided a showcase for many  aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads. experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society. the first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003: the iowa game  commissioned by the democrat hopeful howard dean. more than 20 followed suit  including frontrunner  elections  president forever and the political machine  which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign  including having to cope with the media. others helped raise the stakes during the bush/kerry contest by highlighting a candidate s virtues or his vices.  the phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games  a handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers.   when i started researching political games at the university  about five years ago  i thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen   said gonzalo frasca  computer games specialist at the information technology university of copenhagen.  i must admit that i was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved   added the uruguayan-born researcher  who has so far created games for two political campaigns. many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming.com. the aim is to comment on international news events via games.  the ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way.   video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new  but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation   mr frasca told the bbc news website. this was the case with the one he created for a political party in uruguay  cambiemos  an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country s problems could be solved by working together.  it s up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games.  ultimately  dr frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes  fears and beliefs.  children learn a lot about the world through play. there is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up.   but experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns.  this is hardly surprising  compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web. only a few years ago  most politicians did not have a webpage  while now it is almost a must-have. dr frasca said:  political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games. they represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them.   it will not replace other forms of political propaganda  but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns.,0.51029396

38,politics,debate needed  on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet  the elections watchdog has said.  fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report  the electoral commission says it is worth debating a £10 000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.  there were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001  2002 and 2003  with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.  while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap  we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible   says its report. if there was to be a cap  it should be £10 000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.  even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons  european parliament  scottish parliament  welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning  seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets  says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.  the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates  while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said:  there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced.  our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible.  the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.  he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.,4.5467615

2172,sport,middlesbrough 2-2 charlton a late header by teenager danny graham earned middlesbrough a battling draw with charlton at the riverside.  matt holland had put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute after his shot took a deflection off franck queudrue. but middlesbrough peppered the charlton goal after the break and chris riggott stroked home the equaliser. shaun bartlett s strike put charlton back in front but that lead lasted just six minutes before graham rushed onto queudrue s pass to head home. the match burst to life from the whistle and charlton defender hermann hreidarsson had sight of an open goal after just six minutes. hreidarsson received danny murphy s free-kick from the right but he crashed his free header wide of the far post. the iceland international looked such a danger the boro bench could be heard issuing frantic instructions to mark him.  charlton s early pressure paid off when bartlett received a long ball from talal el karkouri in the box and laid it off to holland who buried his right-footed strike. szilard nemeth  recalled in place of joseph-desire job  was twice denied his chance to get middlesbrough back on level terms by dean kiely. the striker played a great one-two with jimmy floyd hasselbaink only to see kiely get down well to smother his shot before directing a header straight into the keeper s arms. boro had plenty of time on the ball but the addicks comfortably mopped up the pressure - with kiely tipping a hasselbaink header over the bar - to take their lead into half-time.  it was all one-way traffic after the break at the riverside as middlesbrough poured forward and kiely even saved hreidarsson s blushes when he palmed the ball away to prevent a charlton own goal. but the addicks keeper could do nothing about riggott s equaliser in the 74th minute. the boro defender looked suspiciously offside as he got on the end of gareth southgate s misdirected effort  but despite the charlton protests his goal stood. the addicks did not let their heads drop and bartlett left the boro defence standing  picking up hreidarsson s cross to easily sink his right-footed strike. but substitute graham was on hand to grab a share of the points for the home side. the 19-year-old striker nodding home the equaliser - and his first premiership goal - with five minutes left on the clock.   i felt we did enough to win the game even though the first half was lacklustre.  we dominated after the break  the players showed a fantastic response and we should have gone on to win.  but for (charlton goalkeeper) dean kiely  who made three tremendous saves  we could have scored five or six.    to take the lead and then to get penned back  it feels a little bit like a defeat   admitted kiely.  we were winning but middlesbrough kept knocking on the door. but we stood up and credit to us we didn t capitulate.  we ll kick on now. our short-term ambition is to progress from the seventh place finish from last year.   nash  reiziger (graham 82)  riggott  southgate  queudrue  parlour (job 86)  doriva  nemeth (parnaby 87)  zenden  downing  hasselbaink.  subs not used: cooper  knight.  riggott 74  graham 86.  kiely  hreidarsson  perry  el karkouri  young  konchesky  murphy (euell 78)  holland  kishishev  thomas (johansson 72)  bartlett.  subs not used: fish  jeffers  andersen.  konchesky  hreidarsson  perry.  holland 14  bartlett 80.  29 603  m riley (w yorkshire).,1.7778275

239,tech,concerns over windows atms cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses  a security firm has warned.  the warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the windows operating system in machines. already there have been four incidents in which windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the microsoft operating system. but banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small.  for many years the venerable ibm operating system  known as os/2  has been the staple software used to power many of the 1.4m cash machines in operation around the world. but ibm will end support for os/2 in 2006 which is forcing banks to look for alternatives. there are also other pressures making banks turn to windows said dominic hirsch  managing director of financial analysis firm retail banking research.  he said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new europay  mastercard and visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data. us laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways. todd thiemann  spokesman for anti-virus firm trend micro  said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks. mr thiemann said research by the towergroup showed that 70% of new cash machines being installed were windows based.  already  he said  there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them.  in january 2003 the slammer worm knocked out 13 000 cash machines of the bank of america and many of those operated by the canadian imperial bank of commerce. in august of the same year  cash machines of two un-named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the welchia worm. incidents like this happen  said mr thiemann  because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers. this often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network.  this could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system   he said.  banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network   mr thiemann told bbc news online.  but mr hirsch from retail banking research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year.  currently  he said  a cash machine has a lifetime of up to 10 years which means that only about 10% of all atms get swapped for a newer model every year.  windows cash machines have been around for several years   he said.  most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle.   in theory there is a bigger threat with windows than os/2   he said   but i do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment.   it s pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with atms   he said. the many different security systems built-in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously  he said. banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all  he added. a spokesman for the association of payment and clearing services (apacs) which represents the uk s payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal.  there s no concern that there s going to be any type of virus hitting the uk networks   he said. risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect uk cash machines together and the operators of the atms themselves were a much smaller and tightly-knit community than in the us where viruses have struck.,-0.5999317

1881,politics,woolf murder sentence rethink plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down.  there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council - led by lord woolf - published its proposals for england and wales. it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity. but that has now been changed to one-sixth  with no reduction for those killers given a  whole life tariff . at the time lord woolf  the lord chief justice  had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example  if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected. the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible  by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation  he said.  but director of the victims of crime trust  norman brennan  accused lord woolf of having an  arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law-abiding public . the national association of probation officers said the move would be  political suicide . in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council (sgc)  the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be  weighed carefully  by a judge so they did not lead to  an inappropriately short sentence . where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty  the maximum reduction would be one sixth  and should never exceed five years  it said.  in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said:  i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines.  i am confident  as a result  that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending.  director of public prosecutions  ken macdonald qc  who sits on the sgc  said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament.  what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process.  it represents a tougher regime than existed previously  because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity   he said.,0.6084771
1303,tech,gamer buys $26 500 virtual land a 22-year-old gamer has spent $26 500 (£13 700) on an island that exists only in a computer role-playing game (rpg).  the australian gamer  known only by his gaming moniker deathifier  bought the island in an online auction. the land exists within the game project entropia  an rpg which allows thousands of players to interact with each other. entropia allows gamers to buy and sell virtual items using real cash  while fans of other titles often use auction site ebay to sell their virtual wares. earlier this year economists calculated that these massively multi-player online role-playing games (mmorpgs) have a gross economic impact equivalent to the gdp of the african nation of namibia.   this is a historic moment in gaming history  and this sale only goes to prove that massive multi-player online gaming has reached a new plateau   said marco behrmann  director of community relations at mindark  the game s developer.  the virtual island includes a gigantic abandoned castle and beautiful beaches which are described as ripe for developing beachfront property. deathifier will make money from his investment as he is able to tax other gamers who come to his virtual land to hunt or mine for gold. he has also begun to sell plots to people who wish to build virtual homes.  this type of investment will definitely become a trend in online gaming   said deathifier. the entopia economy lets gamers exchange real currency into ped (project entropia dollars) and back again into real money. ten peds are the equivalent to one us dollar and typical items sold include iron ingots ($5) and shogun armour ($1.70) gamers can theoretically earn money by accumulating peds through the acquisition of goods  buildings  and land in the entropia universe. mmorpgs have become enormously popular in the last 10 years with hundreds of thousands of gamers living out alternate lives in fantasy worlds. almost 200 000 people are registered players on project entropia.,-0.7749896
1985,politics,ban on hunting comes into force fox hunting with dogs is now illegal in england and wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight.  the law faces a stiff test this weekend  with the countryside alliance saying many hunts will be out in force. chief police officers spokesman nigel yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them. he said police would challenge the  one of two isolated hunts  which are threatening to break the law.  but simon hart of the countryside alliance has questioned how police will ensure there are no violations.  the definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements.  you can hunt a rat  but not a mouse  a rabbit but not a hare  an artificial scent  but not a real one   he said.  the attorney general  lord goldsmith  has so far issued no instructions to police on how they should deal with hunters who violate the law. he said he will consult the director of public prosecutions and the police  in the near future  to decide what measures to take with regards to hunting prosecutions. he has rejected a  blanket policy  of not enforcing the ban until the house of lords has considered its legality. john cooper  a barrister and chairman of the league against cruel sports  said the anti-hunting lobby expects the authorities to prosecute wherever there is clear evidence of illegal hunting practices. he said police had  acknowledged their duty to investigate allegations of hunting offences .  the beaufort hunt had one pack out on thursday and has promised a hunt this weekend. under the new law hunters have a number of legal options available to them.  as well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent  it will still be legal for the hunts to  flush out  foxes  as long as they shoot their quarry rather than set the hounds on them.  we are not going away. we will keep these hounds going  we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again   hunt master  captain ian farquhar  said. but tony banks  labour mp for west ham  said the issue would soon disappear  and that  people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about . he said had the government not prevaricated since 1997 in introducing the ban  hunting with dogs would have passed into history like other former country pursuits such as otter hunting and badger baiting.  let the election decide this because the conservatives have made clear that if they get elected into government they will restore hunting   he said.,0.94801855
1465,politics,parties  plans for council tax anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003  when the average english bill rose 12.9%.  pensioners  protests spread - some marched  others simply refused to pay the increase. some  such as 83-year-old elizabeth winkfield  said they would rather go to jail. the audit commission found the whole local government finance system was  fundamentally flawed  and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change.  labour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient. they say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills  with a £100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils  budgets to keep demands down. deputy prime minister john prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be  radical reform . the party says this year s increases will be the lowest in a decade. a report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation  such as reformed business rates  although no decisions have been made. an independent inquiry into its findings  the lyons review  is due to report back at the end of 2005.  the tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners  who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax. they say they can save £4bn on  government waste   of which £1.3bn could be used to cut pensioners  bills by an average of £340. it would not be means tested  say the tories  because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement. instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill  up to a maximum of £500. the tories also say they are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes - currently graded according to their value in 1991 - because they believe seven million of homes could move up a band.  the liberal democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the usa  norway and switzerland. the rate would be set locally  but administered by the inland revenue which they say would save at least £300m. they say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in britain  because it puts a  ceiling  on what the richest pay. the party says it would aim for a £5 000 tax-free personal allowance  or a £7 000 allowance for the over-65s. after that income would be taxed up to £100 000. the lib dems say their plan is fairer  more efficient  has already been tested abroad and offers more accountability.,1.8147302
1870,sport,jones doping probe begins an investigation into doping claims against marion jones has been opened by the international olympic committee.  ioc president jacques rogge has set up a disciplinary body to look into claims by victor conte  of balco laboratories. jones  who says she is innocent  could lose all her olympic medals after conte said he gave her performance-enhancing drugs before the sydney olympics. but rogge said it was too early to speculate about that  hoping only that  the truth will emerge .  any decision on the medals would be taken by the ioc s executive board and could hinge on interpretation of a rule stating that olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the games closing. the sydney olympics ended more than four years ago  but world anti-doping agency chief dick pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now.  we will find a way to deal with that   pound said. in a statement released through her attorney rich nichols  jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared.  victor conte s allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward   she said.  conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory  inconsistent statements.,-0.5177188
909,politics,campaign  cold calls  questioned labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing  cold calls .  the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people s voting intentions. the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls. the information commissioner s office says surveys are allowed but there is a  grey  area if personal data is kept. telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election.  but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service (tps) lists  which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications.  the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies. but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps. a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. but that did not happen for  voter identification  calls.  when we ask which party they will vote for  that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not   he said.  so it is not covered by the telephone preference service.   he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no  they were not rung again. a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers. she said:  we do apply tps but in line with the law. we would not do things that are not allowed in the law.  a spokesman for the information commissioner s office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. but the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics  not person by person.  if a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing   he said.  the spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future. the spokesman said there was  no yes or no  answer and the area was  pretty grey . he added:  if someone complained  then we would investigate that. political parties are aware of the regulations. at the last by-elections  we reminded them.  lib dem chairman matthew taylor has now written to the watchdog saying:  the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal.  he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are  significant  numbers of such calls.  i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases   he tells the commissioner. mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.,3.8702016
870,business,macy s owner buys rival for $11bn us retail giant federated department stores is to buy rival may department stores for $11bn (£5.7bn).  the deal will bring together famous stores like macy s  bloomingdale s and marshall field s  creating the largest department store chain in the us. the combined firm will operate about 1 000 stores across the us  with combined annual sales of $30bn. the two companies  facing competition from the likes of wal-mart  tried to merge two years ago but talks failed. sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after may s chairman and chief executive gene kahn resigned in january. as part of the deal  federated - owner of macy s and bloomingdale s - will assume $6bn of may s debt  bringing the deal s total value to $17bn. directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year.  may has struggled to compete against larger department store groups such as federated and other retailers such as wal-mart. federated expects the merger to boost earnings from 2007 but the deal will cost it $1bn in one-off charges.   we have taken the first step toward combining two of the best department store companies in america  creating a new retail company with truly national scope and presence   said terry lundgren  federated s chairman. some analysts see the merger as a rescue deal for may.  without this deal may would have been  to put it bluntly  washed up   said kurt barnard  president of barnard s retail consulting group. federated has annual sales of $15.6bn  while may s yearly sales are $14.4bn.,-0.015861034
24,tech,mobile audio enters new dimension as mobile phones move closer to being a ubiquitous  all-in-one media player  audio is becoming ever more important. but how good can that sound be from such a small device   the sound of a buzzing bee jumps from left to right before disappearing around the back of my head. the surround sound demo is unremarkable when heard on a multi-speaker home cinema system but startling when emerging from a small mobile phone. british firm sonaptic is one of a number of companies to have developed 3d audio technology that emerges from stereo speakers. firms am3d and srs both offer stereo-widening technology for mobile phones. but sonaptic s managing director david monteith says his firm is the only company to offer positional 3d audio on a mobile.   there are quite a few basic technologies out there  making the sound seem a bit bigger  headphones a bit nicer.   no-one has really tried before to make proper 3d positional audio - where an individual channel can be moved around.  sonaptic has been working with japanese mobile network ntt docomo to set standards for 3d audio on mobile phones. in the last few months handsets from nec  fujitsu and mitsubishi have been released on to the japanese marker which have chips produced by yamaha and rohm with sonaptic s technology.  the technology has been around on pcs and games consoles for some time but what we are doing is making it more efficient so it can go on a small consumer device like a mobile phone   said mr monteith.  the technology works through applying the science of psychoacoustics and grew out of medical research done by the company s research director dr alastair sibbald.  we are basically trying to fool your ears into thinking sound is coming from areas it actually isn t.  your brain uses certain bits of information which we are effectively synthesising on a mobile phone handset.  the structure of the ear works as a 3d encoder for sound - helping the brain understand from where sound is emanating. sonaptic s audio processing algorithms mimic that 3d encoding  giving the impression that sound is coming from the left  right  and behind a listener when in fact it is coming from a single source. mr montieth says:  if the sound is off to one side it will get to one ear before the other - if it is on the right it has to bend around your head to get to your left ear.   the shape of your ear causes differences in sound from one ear to the other. we are synthesising those differences.  sonaptic hopes the technology will have a big impact in the growing market of mobile gaming and music downloading.  handhelds often have limitations - screens will be small by definition.  if you want to get impact from media you are running - either a movie  a game or watching tv - if you want it to be more immersive then our technology can help.  a fishing game is the first title to use the technology  creating a 3d sound field while the gamer plays. driving games and shoot  em ups using the technology are in development. the technology can also be used for music - giving songs a much more expansive and immersive feel. sonaptic offers its technology on a chip or in software and is about to release a new version which significantly improves the efficiency of the audio processing.  it s important we only use 10 or 15% of the processor otherwise you won t be able to play a game on the handset   explained mr montieth. the company is now looking to the us and european markets  where it has been working with network vodafone.  we have focused first on japan because it has a very advanced mobile phone market.  we knew japan would be the first place to have the handsets that could use our technology.  there should be handsets out in the uk in the next six months.,-0.8683877
977,sport,jones happy with henson heroics wales fly-half stephen jones admitted he was happy to hand gavin henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against england.  jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when wales  9-8 down  were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in cardiff.  i knew the percentages of gavin reaching it were far higher than me   jones said.  when he said he wanted it  there were no problems.  jones had seen a long-range effort fall a whisker under the crossbar on the hour  before charlie hodgson put england in front with 10 minutes left.  i looked at where it was and i knew i was going to struggle to make it   jones added.  i said to gareth (thomas  the wales captain)  this is touch and go.  it was out of my range and obviously gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance. he was confident and fancied it.  there were no questions that he d miss it the way he was playing. he had a superb game.  jones was happy to hail henson s heroic contribution to wales  first win over england in cardiff since 1993.  physically he s a specimen: he s a balanced player  he glides when he runs and obviously he s got a great kicking game as well   jones said.   his defence was superb  he made some great hits and he had a great game.  i m glad he s welsh.  victory over england for the first time since 1999 will no doubt fuel expectations of what wales might achieve in this year s six nations. but they now face three away fixtures in italy  france and scotland before completing their campaign against ireland in cardiff.  people all over the world want to see wales back at the top table of world rugby   said a proud coach mike ruddock.  but we are not there yet. the next step is finding the consistency to get further wins.  we have to travel this week and we can t afford to get too giddy about this result.  we have got to be professional and keep focused on facing italy.   none more so than henson  who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of jonny wilkinson and brian o driscoll. the confident 23-year-old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however.  i m the sort of player who likes pressure on me   he said.  it makes me more concentrated and i think i perform better under more pressure.  i set a high standard against england and i ve got to back it up next week.  two years ago when we played italy i wasn t involved and we lost  so we ve got to put that right next week.,-0.41343784
2103,tech,ds aims to touch gamers the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. market leader nintendo  however  is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played.  the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks. far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld  it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens  and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen.  the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm s pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market.  nintendo first launched its gameboy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since. but its lead can no longer be taken for granted. sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable  while start-up companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices.  we believe the ds will appeal to all ages  both genders and gamers of any skill   said david yarnton  nintendo europe s general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. with its two screens  wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance  the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points. it went on sale in the us in mid-november priced $150 and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations  without giving detailed figures. japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device. with more than two million pre-orders for the device in japan  nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot. but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed  the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters - a 3d action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine s wireless capabilities. it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people.  the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. super mario 64 ds is a faithful re-creation of the nintendo 64 classic with a host of new mini-games and new levels. the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. one thing is for certain. hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices  ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds s key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up. the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks.,-1.820992
899,sport,williams stays on despite dispute matt williams insists he has no thoughts of quitting as national coach as a result of the power struggle currently gripping scottish rugby.  the chairman  chief executive and three non-executive directors all departed in a row over the game s future direction. but williams said:  i want to make it clear that i m committed totally to scottish rugby.  i ve brought my family here and we ve immersed ourselves in scottish life. there s no way that i m walking away.  however  he attempted to steer clear of taking sides in the dispute.  i d like to stress that the national team is separate to the political situation   he said.   when you come to an undertaking like this and you are trying to make a difference then there are always people who will begrudge you  who are jealous and want to try to drag you down.  when you have that situation  you have to have the courage of your convictions to see it through.  there was some very unhelpful and uninformed comment that the national team had received a massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of scottish rugby and that is simply not the case.  like all good coaches  you go and ask for an increase. but we were told in no uncertain terms that the financial situation did not allow that.  the idea that we are lighting cigars with £20 notes while the rest of scottish rugby flounders is absolutely untrue.  we also attracted criticism because of the number of days players spent with the national team.  but let me give you the truth. our irish counterparts  whom we have to compete with in a few days  time  had 70 days together at the summer.  they are currently in camp now and they will have another 21 days in camp before the six nations.  that means they will have 91 days away from their club from july until the six nations. we  on the other hand  will have 16.  there must be a win-win philosophy and attitude within scottish rugby and that is what we are after - both groups winning  not competing.,1.4119186

1742,tech,technology gets the creative bug the hi-tech and the arts worlds have for some time danced around each other and offered creative and technical help when required.  often this help has come in the form of corporate art sponsorship or infrastructure provision. but that dance is growing more intimate as hi-tech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration. and vice versa. uk telco bt is serious about the idea and has launched its connected world initiative. the idea  says bt  is to shape a  21st century model  which will help cement the art  technology  and business worlds together.  we are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology   said frank stone  head of the bt s business sector programmes. he looks after several  centres of excellence  which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations  one of which is focused on creative industries.  to mark the initiative s launch  a major international art installation is to open on 15 april in brussels  with a further exhibit in madrid later in the summer. they have both been created using the telco s technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm  including a sophisticated graphics rendering program. using a 3d graphics engine  the type commonly used in gaming  bafta-winning artists langlands & bell have created a virtual  story-based  3d model of brussels  coudenberg cellars.  they have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of coudenberg palace  an historical seat of european power. the 3d world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the 19th century.  the river was integral to the city s survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared   said the artists.  we hope that by uncovering the river  we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present  and appreciate the flow of modernity  once concealing  but now revealing the river senne.  in their previous works they used the quake game graphics engine. the game engine is the core component of a video game because it handles graphics rendering  game ai  and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game. they are so time-consuming and expensive to create  the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphics-intensive games. bt s own engine  tara (total abstract rendering architecture) has been in development since 2001 and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners. it was also used in 2003 in encounter  an urban-based  pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical  on-the-street action. because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds  new features were added to tara in order to handle the complex data sets. but collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new  and many keen coders  designers  games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself.  as more tools for self-expression are given to the person on the street  enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance  creativity will become an integral part of technology. the orange expressionist exhibition last year  for example  displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the uk to create an interactive installation.  technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential  not least because it gives people something to do with their technology. big businesses know it is good for them to get in on the creative vein too. the art world is  fantastically rich   said mr stone  with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like bt want to get in with them. between 1997 and 2002  the creative industry brought £21 billion to london alone. it is an industry that is growing by 6% a year too. the partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net  according to mr stone.  this is not just about putting art galleries and museums online   he said.  it is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem.  with broadband penetration reaching 100% in the uk  businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it. the creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously. it is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries  or more patent ideas for tech companies.  what we are trying to do is have outside-in thinking.  we are creating a future cultural drive for the economy   said mr stone.,-0.20654583
2116,tech,a decade of good website design the web looks very different today than it did 10 years ago.  back in 1994  yahoo had only just launched  most websites were text-based and amazon  google and ebay had yet to appear. but  says usability guru dr jakob nielsen  some things have stayed constant in that decade  namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use. dr nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the 34 core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today.  roughly 80% of the things we found 10 years ago are still an issue today   he said.  some have gone away because users have changed and 10% have changed because technology has changed.   some design crimes  such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit  and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared  said dr nielsen.   but there s great stability on usability concerns   he told the bbc news website. dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability  centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site s total design  were as important as ever.  it s necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such   he said. they are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would.  a lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off   he said.  but there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband.   dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google  amazon  ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important.  those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful   said dr nielsen  adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net.   all are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet   he said.  they are making simple but powerful tools available to the user.  none of them have a fancy or glamorous look   he added  declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied. in the future  dr nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online.  they are becoming like the operating system to the internet   he said. but  he said  the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better. currently  he said  search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries. often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not. tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results. research by dr nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines. the latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that  on average  they use 2.2 terms. in 1994 only 1.3 words were used.  i think it s amazing that we have seen a doubling in a 10-year period of those search terms   said dr nielsen.  you can hear more from jakob nielsen and web design on the bbc world service programme  go digital,0.6768942
1722,business,$1m payoff for former shell boss shell is to pay $1m (£522 000) to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in april 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves.  judy boynton finally left the firm on 31 december  having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive jeroen van der veer. in january 2004  shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20% smaller than previously thought. shell said the pay-off was in line with ms boynton s contract. she was leaving  by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities   the firm said in a statement. the severance package means she keeps long-term share options  but fails to collect on a 2003 incentive plan since the firm has failed to meet the targets included in it.  the revelation that shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman  sir phil watts  and production chief walter van der vijver.  an investigation commissioned by shell found that ms boynton had to share responsibility for the company s behaviour. despite receiving an email from mr van de vijver which said the firm had  fooled  the market about its reserves  the investigation said  she did nothing to inquire further. in all  shell restated its reserves four times during 2003. in september  it paid £82.7m in fines to regulators on both sides of the atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves.,-0.60345316
872,sport,man utd through after exeter test manchester united avoided an fa cup upset by edging past exeter city in their third round replay.  cristiano ronaldo scored the opener  slipping the ball between paul jones  legs after just nine minutes. united wasted a host of chances to make it safe as jones made some great saves  but wayne rooney put the tie beyond doubt late on with a cool finish. exeter had chances of their own  sean devine twice volleying wide and andrew taylor forcing tim howard to save. united boss sir alex ferguson was taking few chances after their 0-0 draw in the first game and he handed starts to paul scholes and ryan as well as ronaldo and rooney. exeter began brightly with devine and steve flack seeing plenty of the ball  but it did not take united long to assert their authority and the hosts soon found themselves a goal down. scholes played a lovely pass in to ronaldo on the left-hand side of the six-yard box and the portuguese winger slid the ball between the legs of jones to open the scoring.  united sensed a chance to finish the tie as a contest early on and ronaldo blazed over before jones saved well from scholes and then rooney. the visitors  pressure by now was incessant and rooney had another shot blocked while ronaldo slammed well over the bar again from a good position. just before the break giggs had a golden chance to double the advantage  but the welshman dragged a left-foot effort badly wide from 10 yards. in stoppage time exeter created their best chance as alex jeannin swung in a cross from the left that devine managed to flick goalwards  but the ball flew wide of howard s goal. the grecians came out after the break in determined fashion and howard had to show safe hands to collect two searching crosses into the united box. rooney looked like he might have sealed the result with a turn and shot but the ball stuck in the st james park mud and jones raced back to gather on the goalline. moments later devine had the chance to make himself a hero  but he could only volley jeannin s brilliant cross wide of howard s goal after being left unmarked six yards out. after rooney had completely messed up a free-kick 20 yards out taylor showed him how it should be done  his stunning drive from distance forcing a flying stop from howard. the home crowd were baying for a goal and they did get the ball into the net only for devine s low effort to be ruled out for an obvious offside. the persistent rooney eventually rounded jones with three minutes to go and slotted into an empty net to book a home tie with middlesbrough in the fourth round.  jones  hiley  sawyer  gaia  jeannin  moxey  taylor (martin 89)  ampadu (afful 69)  clay  flack (edwards 74)  devine. subs not used: rice  todd.  ampadu  clay.  howard  phil neville  gary neville  o shea  fortune  giggs (saha 70)  miller (fletcher 66)  scholes  djemba-djemba (silvestre 80)  ronaldo  rooney. subs not used: ricardo  bellion.  ronaldo 9  rooney 87.  9 033.  p dowd (staffordshire).,2.2178879

937,tech,the force is strong in battlefront the warm reception that has greeted star wars: battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay  but of its back-to-basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient.  geared towards online gamers  it is based around little more than a series of all-out gunfights  set in an array of locations all featured in  or hinted at during  the two blockbusting film trilogies. previous star wars titles like the acclaimed knights of the old republic and jedi knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchise s extensive universe  and their use of weird and wonderful new characters. battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves.  the sights  sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans  who may well feel that the opportunity to relive star wars  most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for. the mayhem can be viewed from either a third or first-person perspective  and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join darth vader on the dark side  depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the player s personal propensity for good or evil.  there is ample chance to be a wookie  shoot ewoks and rush into battle alongside a fired-up luke skywalker. in each section  the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops  seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet. it really is no more complicated than that. locations include the frozen wastes of hoth  the ice planet from the empire strikes back  complete with massive mechanical at-ats on the march. there are also the dusty  sinister deserts of tatooine and geonosis  as well as the forest moon of endor  where return of the jedi s much-maligned ewoks lived. the feel of those places is well and truly captured  with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic. it is worth noting though that on the playstation 2  the game s graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the xbox version. the pivotal element behind battlefront s success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of large-scale war. the number of combatants  noise and abundance of laser fire see to that  and the sense of chaos really comes over.  speaking of noise  battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the star wars galaxy s audio motifs.  the multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar  as are the stirring john williams symphonies that never let up. there is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section. it has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being star wars  it would not stand up for long. the gameplay is reliable  bog-standard stuff  short on originality. there are also odd annoyances  like the game s insistence on re-spawning you miles away from the action  an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear. and some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be. that said  it is still great fun to pilot a scout walker or speeder bike  however non user-friendly they prove. whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind  battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game. the above-average ai of the enemy sees to that  although given the frenetic environments they operate in  their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated. battlefront s novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast  leaving behind a slightly empty one-trick-pony of a game. but for a while  it is an absolute blast  and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from george lucas  stable.,-1.4106894
1094,business,gold falls on imf sale concerns the price of gold has fallen after the international monetary fund (imf) said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief.  by revaluing its holdings  the imf may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the world s poorest nations. the plan was put forward by g7 finance ministers over the weekend. the price of gold fell to $413.50 an ounce in asia  before rebounding slightly in early european trading.  imf boss rodrigo rato was asked by g7 ministers to carry out a study into the feasibility of revaluing and selling gold reserves.  he is expected to present his conclusions at an imf meeting in washington during april.  whatever happens the market is going to be disconcerted and on the back foot until the april imf meetings   said john reade  an analyst at ubs. the imf values its gold reserves at between $40 and $50 an ounce  a price that was fixed in the 1970s and is about a tenth of the metal s current market value. the imf has 3 217 tonnes of gold  or about 113.5m ounces. bringing the book price of the gold in line with market value would boost the imf s balance sheet  giving it more money to distribute.  this idea has been put forward before  but there now seems to be a more committed political drive to address the issue of global poverty.  this is the first time there has been a mention of the use of gold in a g7 communiqu&#233; for achieving debt relief   said uk chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown. at their meeting in london  g7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts owed by some of the world s poorest countries. mr brown said the meeting would be remembered as  the 100% debt relief summit . while debt relief seems to have jumped to the top of the global agenda  not everyone is convinced that selling imf gold is the best way forward. the us  which can veto any plan to sell imf gold should it so choose  said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem.  the us is not convinced that s the necessary way to do it   said treasury under secretary john taylor. canada  a key gold producer  also expressed reservations.,-0.80487823
1121,tech,playstation 3 processor unveiled the cell processor  which will drive sony s playstation 3  will run 10-times faster than current pc chips  its designers have said.  sony  ibm and toshiba  who have been working on the cell processor for three years  unveiled the chip on monday. it is being designed for use in graphics workstations  the new playstation console  and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip. the chip will run at speeds of greater than 4 ghz  the firms said. by comparison  rival chip maker intel s fastest processor runs at 3.8 ghz. details of the chip were released at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco. the new processor is set to ignite a fresh battle between intel and the cell consortium over which processor sits at the centre of digital products. the playstation 3 is expected in 2006  while toshiba plans to incorporate it into high-end televisions next year. ibm has said it will sell a workstation with the chip starting later this year.  cell is comprised of several computing engines  or cores. a core based on ibm s power architecture controls eight  synergistic  processing centres. in all  they can simultaneously carry out 10 instruction sequences  compared with two for current intel chips.  later this year  intel and advanced micro devices plan to release their own  multicore  chips  which also increase the number of instructions that can be executed at once. the cell s specifications suggest the playstation 3 will offer a significant boost in graphics capabilities but analysts cautioned that not all the features in a product announcement will find their way into systems.  any new technology like this has two components   said steve kleynhans  an analyst with meta group. he said:  it has the vision of what it could be because you need the big vision to sell it.  then there s the reality of how it s really going to be used  which generally is several levels down the chain from there.   while the playstation 3 is likely to be the first mass-market product to use cell  the chip s designers have said the flexible architecture means that it would be useful for a wide range of applications  from servers to mobile phones. initial devices are unlikely to be any smaller than a games console  however  because the first version of the cell will run hot enough to need a cooling fan. and while marketing speak describes the chip as a  supercomputer  - it remains significantly slower than the slowest computer on the list of the world s top 500 supercomputers. ibm said cell was  os neutral  and would support multiple operating systems simultaneously but designers would not confirm if microsoft s windows was among those tested with the chip. if cell is to challenge intel s range of chips in the marketplace  it will need to find itself inside pcs  which predominantly run using windows.,-2.1512694
1427,tech,gamers could drive high-definition tv  films  and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens.  it is called high-definition - hd for short - and it is already hugely popular in japan and the us. it is set  according to analysts  to do for images what cds did for sound. different equipment able to receive hd signals is needed though and is expensive. but europe s gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand. europeans will have to wait until at least 2006 until they see mainstream hdtv.  to view it  it needs to be transmitted in hd format  and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high-quality resolution. the next generation of consoles  however  are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005  start of 2006. and most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high-resolution pictures.  in the next generation [of consoles] hd support is mandatory   dr mark tuffy games systems director at digital content firm thx told the bbc news website.  every game is going to be playable in hd.  so consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on hdtvs  and who have no content to watch  are going to be blown away by these really high-detail pictures.  it s going to change really the way they look at gaming.   at the end of last year  chris deering  sony s european president  made a prediction that 20 million european households would have hdtv sets by 2008. a previous prediction from analysts datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008  an increase from an estimated 50 000 sets at the end of 2003. but those in europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about £2 000 - if there are few programmes or films to watch on them. satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in 2006 and the bbc intends to produce all of its content in hd by 2010.  until broadcast rights  format standards - and the practicalities of updating equipment - are agreed  tv content will be limited. all tv images are made up of pixels which go across the screen  and scan lines which go down the screen. most standard uk tv pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. hd offers up to 1 080 active lines  with each line made up of 1 920 pixels. this means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard tv.  probably  in the uk [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off  as in  look what this tv can do   until hd is really adopted by broadcasters   explains dr tuffy. but gamers are also the ideal target audience for hd because they always crave better quality graphics  and more immersive gaming experiences. they are used to spending money on hardware to match a game s requirements. demographics have changed too and the  sweet spot  for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s. this means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big-screen  high-definition display technologies and hd projectors  earlier than others.  higher capacity storage discs  such as hd-dvd and blue-ray   are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics.  for console developers though  hd offers some production changes. it could make games production slightly more expensive  thinks dr tuffy.  but we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a pc game and apply it to a console   he says.  you are literally going to get to the point  with a lord of the rings game for example  is going to be closer and closer to the actual film  especially the cgi stuff from the dvd.  and the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game  just now they have almost got it seamless.  with hd  he says  the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release. this could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry. but it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide. at that point  says dr tuffy  games could become more or less interactive movies.,-3.3772993
2007,tech,new delay hits eu software laws a fresh delay has hit controversial new european union rules which govern computer-based inventions.  the draft law was not adopted by eu ministers as planned at a brussels meeting on monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed. the fresh delay came after polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation.  there was at one point the intention to put the item on today s agenda. but in the end we could not put it on   an eu spokesman told the reuters agency. he added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.  in december  poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. poland is a large eu member  so its backing for the legislation is vital. the eu says the law would bring europe more in line with how such laws work in the us  but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. in the us  the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. this means that the us-based amazon.com holds a patent for its  one-click shopping  service. critics say a similar model in europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. but supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.,3.278137

2187,sport,jones files conte lawsuit marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against balco boss victor conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.  the sydney olympic gold medallist says conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (£13m) in the suit. conte  whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation  made the claims in a us television programme. he and three others were indicted in february by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. in an email to the associated press on wednesday  conte said:  i stand by everything i said . jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in sydney in 2000. her lawsuit  filed in the us district court in san francisco  said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she  has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs . conte s statements  the suit added  were  false and malicious . after the abc television program earlier this month  jones  lawyer richard nicholls said:  marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never  ever used performance-enhancing drugs.  victor conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment  while marion jones is one of america s most decorated female athletes. mr conte s statements have been wildly contradictory.  mr conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television  while marion jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.   mr conte is simply not credible. we challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that marion jones passed.  the sport s ruling body  the iaaf  is taking a cautious approach to conte s allegations but contacted the us anti-doping agency. communications director nick davies said the iaaf would seek to contact conte  for further information . but davies stressed it would be up to the american authorities to decide whether they will take action against jones in light of conte s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely.  if it is felt there is case to answer  it would be for its national governing body (usa track and field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action   he added.  the us anti-doping agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war.  and i am sure  like ourselves  they will be watching the television programme with great interest.  jones  who is under investigation for steroid use by the us anti-doping agency  has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the balco scandal  although she praised a zinc supplement conte marketed. jones  who did not win any medals in athens in august  has never failed a drugs test. meanwhile  conte  who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering  is due to face trial in march.,3.7755308
1104,business,unilever shake up as profit slips anglo-dutch consumer goods giant unilever is to merge its two management boards after reporting  unsatisfactory  earnings for 2004.  it blamed the poor results on sluggish decision making  a rise in discounted retailers and a wet european summer. the company also cited difficult trading conditions and a lack of demand for goods such as its slimfast range. unilever  which owns brands including dove soap  said annual pre-tax profit fell 36% to 2.9bn euros (£1.99bn). shares fell 1% to 510.75 pence in london  and dropped by 1.2% to 50.50 euros in amsterdam.  under the restructuring plans  patrick cescau  the uk-based co-chairman  will become group chief executive. dutch co-chairman antony burgmans will take on the role of non-executive chairman.   we have recognised the need for greater clarity of leadership and we are moving to a simpler leadership structure that will provide a sharper operational focus   mr burgmans said.  we are leaving behind one of the key features of unilever s governance but this is a natural development following the changes introduced last year.  the company  which has had dual headquarters in rotterdam and london since 1930  will announce the location of its head office at a later date. unilever is not alone in trying to simplify its business. oil giant shell last year dismantled its dual-ownership structure  after a series of problems relating to the size of its oil reserves that hammered its share price and led to the resignation of key board members.  the best part of the news this morning was that the company announced a structure simplification   said arjan sweere  an analyst at petercam.  the company said the organizational changes would speed decision making  and it also may make further changes.  the company said its main focus will be on improving profits  and it is planning to accelerate and increase investment in its 400 main brands.  while it is certainly the case that markets have been tougher in the past eighteen months than we had expected  we have also lost some market share   said mr cescau.  we let a range of targets limit our ability flexibility and did not adjust our plans quickly enough to a more difficult business environment.   our objective is to reverse the share loss that we experienced in some markets in 2004 and return to growth.   unilever said european sales fell 2.8% last year  dragged down by below part sales at its beverage division  where revenues dipped by almost 4%.  sales of ice cream and frozen food dipped by 3.4% in the us last year  revenue grew by 1.5%  despite disappointing sales in slimfast   the company said. in asia  leading products came under  attack  from rivals such as procter & gamble. unilever took a 1.5bn euro one-time charge in the fourth quarter  including a 650m euro write-down on slimfast diet foods. sales of slimfast products have been hit in recent years by the popularity of the atkins diet. but looking ahead  unilever said it was optimistic about prospects for its slimming products saying that demand is on the wane for rival low-carbohydrate diets. the company also said it planned to spend 500m euros this year buying back shares.,0.74859524

341,entertainment,u2 s desire to be number one u2  who have won three prestigious grammy awards for their hit vertigo  are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world.  the most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common. the music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive  if not always groundbreaking. but such success is down to more than music. they have to be compelling performers  charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground. they also have to want it. they have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it. the beatles had it  the rolling stones still have it  rem hold onto it and queen were it in a catsuit. and u2 have it in spades  and keep churning it out. their new album  how to dismantle an atomic bomb  comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in dublin and 17 years after the joshua tree cemented their place on the all-time rock a-list.  they may have lost some of the edginess and raw  youthful force that propelled them to the top  but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums.  vertigo  the first single from the new album  went straight into the uk singles chart at number one  knocking eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit.  the challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make records the whole world will listen to   bono recently said. drummer larry mullen jr echoed those sentiments:  we re very competitive - we want to be on the radio  have big singles. we don t want to be thought of as a veteran band.  the band have done  everything in their considerable powers  to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world  according to q magazine editor paul rees.   this makes them hugely determined and formidable.  he added:  they are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up.  as such  they ve constantly re-invented and challenged themselves. they are  perhaps  alone as the only rock band that has got better with age.  the other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised  mr rees said.  they do everything in the right way.  the group were born when mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board  attracting fellow pupils paul hewson (bono  vocals)  adam clayton (bass)  david evans (the edge  guitar) and his brother dick.  dick evans soon dropped out and the four-piece were known as the feedback and the hype before settling on u2.  by 1978  they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager  paul mcguinness.  they were brilliant  but very coarse   mcguinness recently said.  in a way  they were doing exactly what they do now. only badly.  they struggled to attract record company attention  later being described as  pretty damn average  and  strange and eerie  by scouts who saw them live. they released two ireland-only singles  which topped the national charts in 1979 and 1980  leading to a deal with island and their debut album boy. the stadium-filling  anthemic sound was u2 s aim from the start  and their third album  war  saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the atlantic  going to number one in the uk and 12 in the us. songs like sunday bloody sunday and new year s day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which bono rejected as a cliche.  his stage performances - which included flag-waving  speaker-climbing and drum-throwing - earned him a reputation as an electric performer  and their appearance at 1985 s live aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom.  in 1987  the joshua tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including where the streets have no name  i still haven t found what i m looking for and with or without you. those songs took the band s epic  atmospheric sound to a simple  powerful and popular pinnacle. the end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements. these came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music  plus wildly extravagant stage shows  while still trying to retain their mass appeal. the achtung baby album in 1991 was followed by zooropa  pop and their corresponding stadium tours  which featured giant olives  flying cars  live phone calls to the white house and bono s transformation into alter-egos the fly and macphisto. he was also building a parallel reputation - not always to the pleasure of his bandmates - as a campaigner on issues from global debt to aids. before the release of how to dismantle an atomic bomb  they had sold 125 million albums around the world. but they still want more.,-3.7164373

1804,tech,dublin hi-tech labs to shut down dublin s hi-tech research laboratory  media labs europe  is to shut down.  the research centre  which was started by the irish government and the massachusetts institute of technology  was a hotbed for technology concepts. since its opening in 2000  the centre has developed ideas  such as implants for teeth  and also aimed to be a digital hub for start-ups in the area. the centre was supposed to be self-funded  but has failed to attract the private cash injection it needs. in a statement  media labs europe said the decision to close was taken because neither the irish government nor the prestigious us-based massachusetts institute of technology (mit) was willing to fund it. prime minister bertie ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies  in an attempt to regenerate the area.  about three dozen small firms were attracted to the area  but it is thought the effects of the dot.com recession damaged the labs  long-term survival. the labs needed about 10 million euros (us$13 million) a year from corporate sponsors to survive.  in the end  it was too deep and too long a recession   said simon jones  the labs  managing director. ian pearson  bt s futurologist  told the bbc news website that the closure was a  real shame . bt was just one of the companies that had worked with the labs  looking at rfid tag developments and video conferencing.  there were a lot of very talented  creative people there and they came up with some great ideas that were helping to ensure greater benefits of technology for society.  i have no doubt that the individuals will be quickly snapped up by other research labs  but the synergies from them working as a team will be lost.   noel dempsey  the government s communications minister  said mr ahern had been  very committed  to the project.  he is  i know  very disappointed it has come to this. at the time it seemed to be the right thing to do   he said.  unfortunately the model is not a sustainable one in the current climate.   during its five years  innovative and some unusual ideas for technologies were developed. in recent months  14 patent applications had been filed by the labs. many concepts fed into science  engineering  and psychology as well as technology  but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term. several research teams explored how which humans could react with technologies in ways which were entirely different. the human connectedness group  for example  developed the iband  a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships. this information could be beamed to another wearer when two people shook hands. other projects looked at using other human senses  like touch  to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment  or on the body itself. one project examined how brainwaves could directly control a computer game. the labs  set up in an old guinness brewery  housed around 100 people  made up of staff  researchers  students  collaborators and part-time undergraduate students. it is thought more than 50 people will lose their jobs when the labs close on 1 february. according to its latest accounts  media lab europe said it spent 8.16 million euros (about us$10.6 million) in 2003 and raised just 2.56 million euros (us$3.3 million).,-0.66523457

1794,sport,robinson ready for difficult task england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales.  robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates sunday s set-to with france at twickenham. lewis moody and martin corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems. and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat. olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour. the bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against france  with either tait or noon dropping out.  tait  given little opportunity to shine in attack  received praise from robinson afterwards  even if the coach admitted cardiff was an  unforgiving place  for the teenage prodigy. robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line  after just one outing  a player he regards as central to england s future. tait himself  at least outwardly  appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular.  i want more of that definitely   he said.  hopefully i can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we ll have to look at the video and wait and see.  we were playing on our own 22 for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult. i thought we defended reasonably well but we ve just got to pick it up for france.   his newcastle team-mate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test. he missed a tackle on michael owen in the build-up to wales  try  conceded a penalty at the breakdown  was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson s cross-kick into touch  all inside the first quarter. his contribution improved in the second half  but england clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role. up front  the line-out remains fallible  despite a superb performance from chris jones  whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody. it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards  with andy hazell likely to make way. lock ben kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side  but elsewhere england positives were thin on the ground.,0.28104115

490,sport,giggs handed wales leading role ryan giggs will captain wales as he wins his 50th cap in wednesday s friendly against hungary in cardiff.  john toshack  in his first game as coach after succeeding mark hughes  admits he is surprised that giggs has only just reached the landmark.  with the games he s played for united  proportionately it doesn t seem that many for wales   toshack said.  but he s one of the greatest of all welsh internationals and on his 50th cap it s appropriate he s captain.  giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game  but is now targetting playing for wales in the 2008 european championships. the manchester united wing revealed how club manager sir alex ferguson talked him into extending his wales career.  i briefly discussed my international future with sir alex  but he urged me to carry on   giggs said.  he feels  like myself  that i have no weight problems and keep myself fit  so in three or four years  time i will be able to play in the european finals if we get there.  the manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because i am fit enough.   giggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former wales skipper gary speed and united team-mate paul scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football. but giggs is now focussed on making the toshack era even more successful than the time hughes spent at the helm. the manchester united winger won his first cap as a 17-year-old in 1991  an away loss to germany  and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31. with giggs leading wales out against hungary  there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to speed. however  toshack refused to reveal whether he sees giggs as a long-term option.  for this particular game i think it is appropriate that ryan giggs will be captain  it s his 50th cap and he s known for some time about that   toshack said. on wednesday night toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing hughes  and giggs said:  it s my 50th cap and i am looking forward to it  and i hope to play a lot more times from here on in.  it s important to be here  all the players feel the same. it s a new start and all the top players certainly see it as important.  i see myself leading by example  it is something i have taken on for wales as well as united these past few seasons.  the way john is looking at things  he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament  the euro 2006 event.  i have told john i will be around for the next european tournament  by then i will be 35 so hopefully i will still be okay.  a lot can happen  but i m hoping to be around.  giggs  own personal future at old trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract  with manchester united offering one extra year and giggs seeking two.  i have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment   said giggs.  it is an important period for the club and i am just concentrated on that.  i ve heard the suggestions  hopefully there is a two-year deal about to be offered because that is what i am looking for  to get it sorted out.  i m enjoying my football  the way united have been playing and my own form  you have to enjoy it.  we have massive games coming up: manchester city this week  then the everton cup tie  followed by ac milan in the champions league  and my first wales game under john toshack  so it s an important time.,0.70116806
364,entertainment,bangkok film festival battles on organisers of the third bangkok international film festival have been determined to carry on with this year s event despite the ravages of the asian tsunami disaster.  the festivities have been scaled down  red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund. apart from this  however  the festival has continued as originally planned.  when the disaster happened  we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel   said the festival s executive director  craig prater.  the decision was made that we would continue  but that the focus would change.   our premieres became fundraisers  the opening night was visibly toned down and 10% of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund   he continued.  but we feel like we ve turned a page. we ve acknowledged our position  and now it s business as usual.   mr prater s sentiments were echoed by christine rush  director of the festival s sister event  the bangkok film market.  we have been careful to be respectful of the thai nation s recovery from this terrible disaster   she said.   however  the nation s recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life.  we are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out   she added. given the conspicuously low audience figures  that support may be more symbolic than significant. however  poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties.  the eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles  including such oscar hopefuls as ray charles biopic ray and mike leigh s abortion drama vera drake. that said  the absence of thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers.  on a more positive note  the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city. problems securing air transport  the clash with last sunday s golden globes ceremony in los angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel.  but the festival has still attracted such hollywood directors as oliver stone and joel schumacher  alongside such screen stars as michael douglas  jeremy irons and jean-claude van damme. irons  whose film being julia is in competition for the festival s golden kinnaree awards  said he had wondered whether he should attend after december s catastrophe.  i questioned whether i should come when such a tragedy had happened   the british actor said.  i thought it might be in rather bad taste. but then i spoke to the organisers and i was encouraged to let life go on.  now i ve come here i m very glad. what impresses me about thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the west   he continued.  basically i was invited here by thailand. if they still want you to come  you should.   now in its third year  bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar. and while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in hong kong  tokyo and pusan in south korea  mr prater predicts it will soon become their equal.  it s grown awfully fast in three years - maybe too fast   he concedes.  we ve had some bumps in the road  but that s only because the festival is still a baby.  i have no doubt in my mind that in five years  this will be the top asian film festival in the world.  the golden kinnarees will be awarded on friday. the festival itself runs until 24 january.,-2.3431764
1005,business,ukraine revisits state sell-offs ukraine is preparing what could be a wholesale review of the privatisation of thousands of businesses by the previous administration.  the new president  viktor yushchenko  has said a  limited  list of companies is being drawn up. but on wednesday prime minister yulia tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3 000 firms. the government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rock-bottom prices. more than 90 000 businesses in all  from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts  have been sold off since 1992  as the command economy built up when ukraine was part of the soviet union was dismantled.  ms tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3 000 businesses which were to be reviewed.  we will return to the state that which was illegally put into private hands.   a day earlier  mr yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted. the list  will be limited and final  and will not be extended after its completion   he said. an open-ended list could further damage outside investors  fragile faith in ukraine  said stuart hensel of the economist intelligence unit. but the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in russia  mr hensel said. as a result  it was planning to resell rather than keep firms in state hands.  they re aware of the need not to scare investors  and to be careful of internal divides within ukraine   he said.  they don t want to be seen to be transferring assets from one set of oligarchs to a new set.  foreign investment in ukraine  at about $40 a head in 2004  is one of the lowest among ex-soviet states.  mr yushchenko became president after two elections in december  the first of which was annulled amid allegations of voting irregularities and massive street protests.  his opponent  viktor yanukovich  still has huge support in the country s eastern industrial heartland. mr yushchenko s administration has accused its predecessor  led by ex-president leonid kuchma  of corruption. the privatisation review s number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included viktor pinchuk  mr kuchma s son-in-law  for $800m (£424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups. the mill  krivorizhstal  is one of the world s most profitable.  we say krivorizhstal was stolen  and at any cost we will return it to the state   mr yushchenko told an investors  conference in kiev.  one of the jilted bidders  netherlands-based group lnm  said it welcomed the possibility that the mill might be back on the market.   if the original privatisation is annulled and a new tender issued  then we would look at it with great interest   a spokesman told bbc news. a resale of krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price  according to the economist intelligence unit s mr hensel. but he warned that the government could decide to take the easy route of revaluing the company and charging the existing owners the revised price rather than undertaking a fresh sale.  that way  mr yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules   he told bbc news.,0.44753933
2018,politics,uk plan to deport terror suspects deals are being sought to allow the uk to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death.  home secretary charles clarke told the times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached. the move follows a law lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at belmarsh prison  london  and woodhill  milton keynes  was unlawful. the 12 affected by the ruling are from algeria  tunisia  egypt and jordan. the government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 september to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.  mr clarke told the times:  i think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come.  he said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with foreign secretary jack straw  in a very positive way . mr clarke said that he was seeking  memorandums of understanding  between overseas governments and britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. however  he added:  i do not think the solution to the law lords  judgement for this government is in deportations  but they will help.  there are other strands that we have to do.  but the liberal democrat s shadow home secretary  mark oaten  accused mr clarke of avoiding the main issue with the belmarsh detainees.   the critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle  to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future   he told bbc news.  and i do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing  for example  intercept communications  telephone tapping to be included   mr oaten said.  deportation may tackle this initial problem but i want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country.   unless we get that  the liberal democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in march.   the bbc s home affairs correspondent  daniel sandford  said it appeared mr clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor  david blunkett. but he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees  home countries could be difficult.  some of these people are accused of very  very serious crimes in their home countries so it s not an easy agreement to get and i think for some of these suspects it won t be the solution.  daniel sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions - such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process - in the next few weeks.  the government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial   he said.,-0.65343475

1463,tech,digital guru floats sub-$100 pc nicholas negroponte  chairman and founder of mit s media labs  says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).  he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. he said one laptop per child could be   very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family  village and neighbourhood . he said the child could use the laptop like a text book. he described the device as a stripped down laptop  which would run a linux-based operating system   we have to get the display down to below $20  to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.   the second trick is to get rid of the fat   if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.  the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture  though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital  now widely seen as predicting the digital age. the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine  where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.  while the idea was popular amongst the children  it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. however  mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops.  we put in 25 laptops three years ago   only one has been broken  the kids cherish these things  it s also a tv a telephone and a games machine  not just a textbook.  mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious.  nokia make 200 million cell phones a year  so for us to claim we re going to make 200 million laptops is a big number  but we re not talking about doing it in three or five years  we re talking about months.  he plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order.  in china they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. that s for five or six years  so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that s cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.,0.58601046

1065,sport,bellamy under new fire newcastle boss graeme souness has reopened his dispute with craig bellamy after claiming the welshman was  not good enough  for the magpies. bellamy left newcastle to join celtic on loan after a major row with souness. souness - who refused to refer to the 25-year-old by name - said bellamy did not score enough goals  the chap that s just gone has scored 9.3 goals a season in his time in senior football - half of those weren t even in the top flight   said souness.  that s not good enough for a striker at a club like this.  we need to have two strikers who are near 20 goals on a regular basis.   bellamy turned down a move to birmingham in favour of joining celtic after a disagreement about the welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated. earlier in the week  souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after bellamy accused him of lying.   there are certain things you can forgive and forget   said souness.  but if i d been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job i have after newcastle.  he could then return to st james  park - and he says that he wants to. however  it would seem unlikely he will play for newcastle again as long as souness remains in charge.,1.3449068
1229,sport,newcastle 2-1 bolton kieron dyer smashed home the winner to end bolton s 10-game unbeaten run.  lee bowyer put newcastle ahead when he fed stephen carr on the right flank  then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross. wanderers hit back through stelios giannakopoulos  who ended a fluid passing move with a well-struck volley. but dyer had the last word in a game of few chances  pouncing on a loose ball after alan shearer s shot was blocked and firing into the top corner. neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game  with plenty of tackles flying in  but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by. bolton keeper jussi jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first-half - keeping out shearer s low shot and dyer s close-range header - but that was the only goalmouth action of note. and it was almost out of nothing that the magpies took the lead on 35 minutes. bowyer found space with a neat turn on the half-way line and striding forward picked out carr to his right. he then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met carr s cross with a downward header into the far corner. bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well.  they were level within six minutes thanks to a smart finish from giannakopoulos. jay-jay okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after a neat exchange of passes involving kevin davies and gary speed  the greek striker found the bottom corner with a first-time strike. the magpies were opened up again before half-time as davies set giannakopoulos in space and given had to block at his near post. but the home side survived  and they should have re-taken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half. fernando hierro cynically chopped down dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through. but the veteran defender escaped with a booking as there were other defenders nearby  and from the resultant free-kick laurent robert curled the ball just wide. bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the magpies. their strategy seemed to be working until the 69th minute. alan shearer s snap-shot was charged down and dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing jaaskelainen from six yards.  - bolton boss sam allardyce  i am bitterly disappointed with the result  but i am probably more disappointed with the second-half performance.  in the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure  and our goal matched theirs in quality.  i thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games  but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half.  we allowed them to heap too much pressure on us  and in the end we cracked.    - newcastle boss graeme souness  we deserved the win. we had a really good second half.  bolton are a difficult side to play. you have to match them physically first but we did that  and then we played some football.  we had a slow first 45 minutes when we looked a bit tired but we got going after that. the scoreline flattered them and we could have had one or two more goals.  newcastle: given  carr  boumsong  bramble  babayaro  dyer  faye  bowyer  robert (jenas 77)  ameobi  shearer. subs not used: butt  harper  milner  hughes. goals: bowyer 35  dyer 69. bolton: jaaskelainen  hunt (fadiga 14)  n gotty  ben haim  candela  giannakopoulos  okocha (vaz te 77)  hierro (campo 64)  speed  gardner  davies. subs not used: jaidi  poole. booked: ben haim  hierro. goals: giannakopoulos 41. att: 50 430 ref: s dunn (gloucestershire).,1.3793852

1682,politics,blair rejects iraq advice calls tony blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation.  the prime minister told his monthly press conference the matter had been dealt with by the attorney general. earlier  conservative mp michael mates joined calls for a probe into claims lord goldsmith s statement to parliament was drawn up at number 10. mr blair said the statement was a  fair summary  of lord goldsmith s opinion.   that s what he (lord goldsmith) said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again   mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue  saying it had been dealt with  literally scores of times and the position has not changed . lord goldsmith has denied being  leaned on  and says the words written were his.  the government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential. mr mates  who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence  told the bbc on friday:  that  as a general rule  is right  but it s not an absolute rule.  he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published  most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention  he said.  mr mates added:  we discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers  advice to the government has been published.  and this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.  this is argument was rejected by mr blair  who said:  firstly  we haven t broken the precedent  and secondly peter goldsmith has made his statement and i have got absolutely nothing to add to it.  in a book published this week  philippe sands qc  a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers  says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action.  but a short statement about lord goldsmith s position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action. mr sands  book suggests it was actually written by home office minister lord falconer and downing street adviser baroness morgan. former minister clare short  who resigned from the government over the iraq war  said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. she told the bbc the full advice should have been attached  according to the ministerial code.   my view is we need the house of lords to set up a special committee  summon the attorney  get all the papers out  look at exactly what happened   she said. the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. on thursday  lord goldsmith said his statement had not been  written by or at number 10 .  in my parliamentary answer on march 17 2003  i explained my genuinely held independent view  that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions   he said.,1.9294279
795,sport,desailly backs blues revenge trip marcel desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when chelsea take on barcelona on wednesday.  the french star was part of the chelsea side crushed 5-1 at the nou camp in the champions league quarter-final second leg in 2000.  things will be totally different this time   he told bbc sport.  now everyone knows about chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. they are one of the major clubs in europe and the pressure will be on barcelona.  chelsea have not played barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. the blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at stamford bridge 3-1  courtesy of two goals from tore andre flo and one by gianfranco zola. but they collapsed in the second leg  going down to strikes from rivaldo (2)  luis figo  dani and patrick kluivert.  former chelsea captain desailly  who is now playing for al-gharafa in qatar  says there is no comparison between that side and the current blues team  who are top of the premiership.  mentally they are much stronger  even though a lot of their players are young   the 36-year-old said.  we made some mistakes at the nou camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes.  it would not happen now. this team has a new motivation and a different mentality.  world cup winner desailly saw huge changes during his time at stamford bridge. he was signed for £4.6m from ac milan in 1998 by ruud gullit and went on to play under gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri. but the biggest change occurred when billionaire roman abramovich bought the club in 2003. desailly says the russian s arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success.  the whole of chelsea is different now - the chairman  the manager and all the players   he said.   everything is new and there is a huge determination to win.  since that game in 2000  chelsea have gained more experience in europe and were very close to reaching the champions league final last season.  desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. he won the 1998 world cup and 2000 european championship with france  the champions league in 1993 with marseilles and 1994 with ac milan  two serie a titles and the fa cup in 2000 with chelsea.  he is now winding down his career in qatar  alongside the likes of frank lebeouf  josep guardiola  titi camara  gabriel batistuta and christophe dugarry. so he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against manchester united on wednesday - paolo maldini and alessandro costacurta.  i m happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level   he said.  i made a vow to costacurta that as long as he plays  i will continue to play.  and it s amazing that paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time.,3.8044567

1531,tech,security scares spark browser fix microsoft is working on a new version of its internet explorer web browser.  the revamp has been prompted by microsoft s growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers. microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals. test versions of the new program  called ie 7  are due to be released by the summer.  the announcement about internet explorer was made by bill gates  microsoft chairman and chief software architect  during a keynote speech at the rsa security conference currently being held in san francisco. although details were scant  mr gates  said ie7 would include new protections against viruses  spyware and phishing scams. this last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information.  in a bid to shore up the poor security in ie 6  microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware. earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the ie browser. microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security. one of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a microsoft anti-spyware program. an own-brand anti-virus program is due to follow by the end of 2005. the decision to make internet explorer 7 is widely seen as a u-turn because  before now  microsoft said it had no need to update the browser. typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the windows operating system. a new version of ie was widely expected to debut with the next version of windows  codenamed longhorn  which is due to appear in 2006. the current version of internet explorer is four years old  and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as firefox and opera. there are also persistent rumours that search engine google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on firefox. in particular the firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in november 2004. estimates of how many users firefox has won over vary widely. according to market statistics gathered by websidestory  firefox s market share is now about 5% of all users. however  other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to 15%. some technical websites report that a majority of their visitors use the firefox browser. internet explorer still dominates with a share of about 90% but this is down from a peak of almost 96% in mid-2004.,2.4489698
1848,politics,mps  murder sentence concern murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea  says a new mps  report.  the influential commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer. the mps also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs. they say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders. committee chairman john denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse.   the committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor.  at present judges  when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence  can reduce the tariff - the minimum term they must serve - if the defendant pleads guilty. but although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims  relatives are unhappy. in july this year amanda champion s killer  james ford  pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least 15 years - it would have been longer had he denied the charge.  amanda s uncle  lewis champion  told the bbc news website ford did not deserve any credit for his plea  saying:  nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence.  mps criticised home secretary david blunkett last year for introducing last-minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty.  the measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after mr blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the criminal justice bill.  as a result  says the committee  the government may need to re-legislate to  remove ambiguity  over how murderers should be sentenced. it is also calling on the senior judge in england and wales  lord woolf  to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in september to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty. the committee said the plans had not reflected the  public disquiet  expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers. lord woolf s sentencing guidelines council (sgc) caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime. as a result murderers who face a 15-year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police.  mr denham believes the sgc should reconsider its proposals to reflect parliament s wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence. he said:  we want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder  reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances.  but a spokesman for the home office defended the proposals. he said:  by making express provision for murder tariffs in the criminal justice act  parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences.  we stand by the provisions in the act that cover guilty plea discounts  which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial.   shadow home secretary david davis echoed criticisms of the way mr blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules.  there is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences - such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government s claim to be tough on crime   he said. but liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten warned the mps  committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference.  the danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful  it is also different   he told bbc news.,1.1713085

1849,politics,howard rebuts asylum criticisms tory leader michael howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas.  mr howard  whose parents fled the nazi threat to come to the uk  says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. his comments come in a bbc documentary called  no more mr nasty . tv presenter anne robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would  like to kick your cat . ms robinson  a friend of the tory leader  also revealed that as a cambridge student mr howard was  much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover  - although she denied having personal experience.  i wasn t at cambridge - and it s not personal experience - but i know people who were.   documentary maker michael cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to mr howard for his film portrait. the tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s  his parents might not have been allowed into the country.  he replies:  what is the inference of that   that if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you re not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants   that seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition  it would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister.   ms robinson  who presents the weakest link tells cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in john major s government.  i used to have to sit on my hands because he d get on television and give a passable impression of someone who d like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. i mean it was very  very draconian.  the film shows mr howard laughing at rory bremner s impression of him as dracula  which he calls  good fun   apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the uk. the film shows the private side of the tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife  ex-model sandra. asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses:  yeah  it would be more enjoyable if i could win occasionally too  but otherwise it s quite fun.   former downing street communications chief alastair campbell  now working on labour s election campaign  says a  touchy-feely  image does not fit mr howard. he says tony blair was not worried by his opponents  early performance in their commons clashes because mr howard lacked a  big strategy   including on issues like iraq. the tory leader brands such criticisms as  absolutely rubbish   arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of mr blair s failure to tell the truth on intelligence. former tory chancellor ken clarke says mr howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the tory party than his personal image. mr clarke says the party is improving and it is  conceivable  it could win the next election. but he adds:  it has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal.   - michael howard: no more mr nasty is being shown on bbc2 on saturday 12 february at 2005 gmt.,0.3488803

1038,tech,apple makes blogs reveal sources apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products.  the bid to unmask the employees leaking information was launched in december 2004 following online articles about apple s asteroid product. now apple has won the right to see e-mail records from the three bloggers to root out the culprit. a lawyer for the three bloggers said the ruling set a dangerous precedent that could harm all news reporters.  apple s lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the asteroid music product and leaking them to the powerpage  apple insider and think secret websites. all three are apple fan sites that obsessively watch the iconic firm for information about future products. apple is notoriously secretive about upcoming products which gives any snippets of information about what it is working on all the more value. the lawsuit to reveal the names of the leakers was filed against the power page and apple insider sites.  the separate legal fight with think secret has yet to be resolved. in the ruling handed down this week by santa clara county superior court judge james kleinberg  apple can now get its hands on e-mail records from the bloggers  net providers. in making his ruling  judge kleinberg said that laws covering the divulging of trade secrets outweighed considerations of public interest. california has so-called  shield  laws which protect journalists from prosecution if what they are writing about can be shown to be in the public interest. the judge wrote:  ...it is not surprising that hundreds of thousands of  hits  on a website about apple have and will happen. but an interested public is not the same as the public interest . judge kleinberg said the question of whether the bloggers were journalists or not did not apply because laws governing the right to keep trade secrets confidential covered journalists  too. the electronic frontier foundation  which is acting as legal counsel for power page and apple insider  said the ruling had potentially wide implications.  anyone who reports on companies or the trade press should be concerned about this ruling   said eff lawyer kurt opsahl. mr opsahl said the eff was planning to appeal against the ruling because the bloggers were journalists and us federal laws stop net firms handing over copies of e-mail messages if the owner of that account does not give their consent.,1.885308

771,politics,opposition grows to house arrests the conservatives have expressed  serious misgivings  about government plans for keeping uk and foreign terror suspects under house arrest.  michael howard said he would not back the home secretary s plans for  control orders  which include home detention.  i do not believe that anyone should be deprived of their liberty on the say so of a politician   he said. the lib dems also oppose the proposals  but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat.  the government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws. new metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair has backed the control orders  saying:  i m sorry. it is a dilemma  but there is only one choice.  but mr howard said:  we have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the british way of life.   he argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison - not at home - while they await trial. mr howard said he feared  internment without trial creates martyrs  and could be  a very effective recruiting sergeant  for terrorists . his party plans to move an amendment to the serious organised crime and police bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court. he called on the prime minister to  enter into constructive discussions  with his party to find a  better way forward . controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the uk without trial or charge since december 2001 was freed from jail.  home secretary charles clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the egyptian man  known only as c  certified as a terrorist suspect. on monday  the legal team for two algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest. most of the terror suspects are detained at belmarsh prison in london. the liberal democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure. home affairs spokesman mark oaten told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  it s a matter of principle for us that we can t have a situation where the home secretary is able to impose house detention now on uk nationals as well as foreign nationals.   the lib dems believe the home secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions.  we think there could be a role for some form of control order - tagging  surveillance  limitation on use of mobile phones - but not with the home secretary s say so. that must be done with a proper judicial process  a judge involved in making those decisions   said mr oaten. mr clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk. he said prosecutions were the government s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in  serious  cases  with independent scrutiny from judges.,3.720055

1241,business,indonesians face fuel price rise indonesia s government has confirmed it is considering raising fuel prices by as much as 30%.  millions of indonesians use kerosene for basic cooking  and prices have been heavily subsidised for years. president susilo bambang yudhoyono s government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor. but critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help. millions of people were left homeless in indonesia aceh s region following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in late december.  indonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices  but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down. it spent 59.2 trillion rupiah ($6.58bn; £3.5bn) on fuel subsidies in 2004  a sum far in excess of its original projection of 14.5 trillion rupiah. since president yudhoyono s government came to power in october  it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies.  the (january to march) quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices   said sri mulyani indrawati  state minister for national development planning.  we are still considering if a 30% hike is suitable at the moment. the sooner the better for the state budget.  the bbc s correspondent in jakarta  rachel harvey  told world business report that there was likely to be a strong public reaction to any price rise.  the big question is whether they go for one big  short  sharp shock and raise prices between 20% and 30% or whether they try to stagger it   she said. indonesia s previous government  led by president megawati sukarnoputri  also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003  but was forced to back down in the face of public protests.,-0.7983041
1915,business,no seasonal lift for house market a swathe of figures have provided further evidence of a slowdown in the uk property market.  the council of mortgage lenders (cml)  british bankers association (bba) and building societies association (bsa) all said mortgage lending was slowing. cml figures showed gross lending fell by 4% in november as the number of people buying new homes fell. elsewhere  the bba added underlying mortgage lending rose by £4m in november  compared to october s £4.29m. the cml said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year-on-year to 85 000 - the lowest total seen since february 2003.  data from the cml showed lending fell to just over £25bn in november  from £25.5bn a year earlier. separate figures from the building societies association showed the value of mortgage approvals -- loans agreed but not yet made -- stood 32% lower than at the same time last year  at a seasonally-adjusted £2.98bn. the figures come hot on the heels of new data from property website rightmove which suggested owners must indulge in a  winter sale  and slash prices by up to 8%. miles shipside  commercial director at rightmove  said sellers would have to be  more realistic with their asking prices  to tempt buyers. the average asking price of a home fell by more than £600 from £190 329 in november to £189 733 in december  while the length of time it takes to sell a home rose to 81 days from 53 in the summer.  rightmove said estate agents were set to enter 2005 with a third more properties on their books than a year ago.  even once the quieter holiday period is over  sellers will find themselves competing with a lot of other properties on the market. in any business  excess supply and low demand means one thing - cut prices   mr shipside said.   the proof is that some properties that have been appropriately discounted are selling  even in the current market.  overall  asking prices have fallen 3.3% from their july peaks as the equivalent of £6 500 has been cut from an average property. a host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in 2005.  what is apparent is a picture of a slowing market  but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole   cml director general michael coogan said.  it s a fairly consistent picture  showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again  which is consistent with a continuing correction in the housing market   investec economist philip shaw said.  however  the figures do suggest only a modest weakening  and we stand by our view that the property market will remain in the doldrums for some time  though a collapse is still unlikely.,2.698637

1314,tech,ea to take on film and tv giants video game giant electronic arts (ea) says it wants to become the biggest entertainment firm in the world.  the us firm says it wants to compete with companies such as disney and will only achieve this by making games appeal to mainstream audiences. ea publishes blockbuster titles such as fifa and john madden  as well as video game versions of movies such as harry potter and the james bond films. its revenues were $3bn (£1.65bn) in 2004  which ea hoped to double by 2009. ea is the biggest games publisher in the world and in 2004 had 27 titles which sold in excess of one million copies each. nine of the 20 biggest-selling games in the uk last year were published by ea.  gerhard florin  ea s managing director for european publishing  said:  doubling our industry in five years is not rocket science.  he said it would take many years before ea could challenge disney - which in 2004 reported revenues of $30bn (£16bn) - but it remained a goal for the company.  we will be able to bring more people into gaming because games will be more emotional.  mr florin predicted that the next round of games console would give developers enough power to create real emotion.   it s the subtleties  the eyes  the mouth - 5 000 polygons doesn t really sell the emotion.   with ps3 and xbox 2  we can go on the main character with 30 000 to 50 000 polygons   he said.  with that increased firepower  the finding nemo video game looks just like the movie  but it will be interactive.  mr florin said that more than 50% of all ea s games were sold to adults and played by adults  but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children.  our goal is to bring games to the masses which bring out emotions.  ea said the video game industry was now bigger than the music industry.  nobody queues for music anymore.    you can t ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it   he said  referring to demand for titles for such as grand theft auto: san andreas and halo 2.  jan bolz  ea s vice president of sales and marketing in europe  said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture. he said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality tv show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game the sims.  one idea could be that you re controlling a family  telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go to the bedroom  and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world  playing the show    said mr bolz.  he also said ea was planning an international awards show  similar to the oscars and the grammys  which would combine video games  music and movies. mr bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities.  people will want to play video games if their heroes like robbie williams or christina aguilera are in them.  mr florin said the challenge was to keep people playing in their 30s  40s and 50s.  there s an indication that a 30 year old comes home from work and still wants to play games.  if that s true  that s a big challenge for tv broadcasters - because watching tv is the biggest pastime at present.,0.9409747

1210,business,us adds more jobs than expected the us economy added 337 000 jobs in october - a seven-month high and far more than wall street expectations.  in a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected president george w bush  the labor department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains. jobs were created in every sector of the us economy except manufacturing. while the separate unemployment rate went up to 5.5% from 5.4% in september  this was because more people were now actively seeking work.  the 337 000 new jobs added to us payrolls in october was twice the 169 000 figure that wall street economists had forecast. in addition  the labor department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139 000 in september instead of 96 000  and to 198 000 in august instead of 128 000. the better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in new york  with the main dow jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10 360 by late morning trading.  it looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays  and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year   said economist gary thayer of ag edwards & sons.  other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the us federal reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when it meets next week.  it should empower the fed to clearly do something   said robert macintosh  chief economist with eaton vance management in boston. kathleen utgoff  commissioner of the bureau of labor  said many of the 71 000 new construction jobs added in october were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in florida  and neighbouring deep south states  following four hurricanes in august and september. the dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro  as investors returned their attention to other economic factors  such as the us s record trade deficit. there is also speculation that president bush will deliberately try to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports.,1.8493161
2043,tech,the year search became personal the odds are that when you fire up your browser  you go straight to your favourite search engine  rather than type in a web address.  some may see this as the height of laziness  but in an era of information overload  search has become a vital tool in navigating the net. it is symptomatic of how the way we use the internet is changing. and as google has shown  there is money in offering a service that people cannot live without. there is no shortage of companies vying for the loyalty of web searchers  offering a wealth of different services and tools to help you find what you want. over the past 12 months  giants of the technology world such as microsoft and yahoo have sought to grab a slice of the search action.  user experience has contributed to people searching more   said yonca brunini of yahoo. as people become more familiar with the internet  they tend to spend more time online and ask more queries  she said.  the other second thing is broadband   ms brunini told the bbc news website.  this will do to internet what colour has done to tv.   but search is hardly a new phenomenon. it has been around since the early days of the net.  veteran surfers will remember old-timers like hotbot and altavista.  search was always important   said urs holzle  google vice-president of operations.  we trumpeted that in 1999. it is even truer now as there are more users and more information.   people didn t realise that search was the future. the financials have something to do with it.  google has shown web commerce can work through its targeted small adverts  which appear at the top and down the right-hand side of a page and are related to the original search. these small ads helped google reach revenues of $805.9m for the three months to september. others have woken up to the fact that you can make money out of web queries.  once you see there is a market  microsoft is bound to step to it. if microsoft sees search as important  then nobody queries it   said mr holzle.  microsoft is just one of the net giants muscling in on search. yahoo  ask jeeves  amazon and a handful of smaller outfits are all seeking to capture eyeballs.  web users face a plethora of choices as each company tries to outflank google by rolling out new search products such as desktop search. it reflects how the battlefield has shifted from the net to your pc. search is not just about finding your way around the web. it is now about unlocking information hidden in the gigabytes of documents  images and music on hard drives. for all these advances  search is still a clumsy tool  often failing to come up with exactly what you had in mind. in order to do a better job  search engines are trying to get to know you better  doing a better job of remembering  cataloguing and managing all the information you come across.  personalisation is going to be a big area for the future   said yahoo s yonca brunini.  whoever cracks that and gives you the information you want is going to be the winner. we have to understand you to give you better results that are tailored to you.  this is perhaps the holy grail of search  understanding what it is you are looking for and providing it quickly. the problem is that no one yet knows how to get there.,-0.5661349

1936,tech,more power to the people says hp the digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories  according to carly fiorina  chief of technology giant hewlett packard.  the job of firms such as hp now  she said in a speech at the consumer electronics show (ces)  was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged. she said the goal for 2005 was to make people the centre of technology. ces showcases 50 000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005. the tech-fest  the largest of its kind in the world  runs from 6 to 9 january.  the digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible   she told delegates.  revolution has always been about giving power to the people.  she added:  the real story of the digital revolution is not just new products  but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell.  part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content  such as images  video and music. crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device  such as a digital camera  to others  such as portable media players. a lot of work still needs to be done  however  to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly  she said.  ms fiorina s talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle  fashion and personalisation  something she sees as key to what people want.  special guest  singer gwen stefani  joined her on-stage to promote her own range of hp digital cameras which ms stefani has helped design and which are heavily influenced by japanese youth culture. the digital cameras  which are due to go on sale in the us by the summer  are based on the hp 607 model. the emphasis on personalisation and lifestyle is a big theme at this year s ces  with tiny  wearable mp3 players at every turn and rainbow hues giving colour to everything. ms fiorina also announced that hp was working with nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles  which would launch in europe early this year. the service will let people listen to radio on their mobiles and download relevant content  like a track s ringtone  simultaneously. the service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive.  among the other new products she showcased was the digital media hub  a big upgrade to hp s digital entertainment centre. coming out in the autumn in the us  the box is a networked  high-definition tv  cable set-top box  digital video recorder and dvd recorder. it has a removable hard drive cartridge  memory card slots  and light scribe labelling software which lets people design and print customised dvd labels and covers. it is designed to contain all a household s digital media  such as pre-recorded tv shows  pictures  videos and music so it can all be managed in one place. the hub reflects the increasing move to re-box the pc so that it can work as part of other key centres of entertainment. research suggests that about 258 million images are saved and shared every day  equating to 94 billion a year. eighty per cent of those remain on cameras. media hubs are designed to encourage people to organise them on one box. ms fiorina was one of several keynote speakers  who also included microsoft chief bill gates  to set out what major technology companies think people will be doing with technologies and gadgets in the next 12 months. in a separate announcement during the keynote speech  ms fiorina said that hp would be partnering mtv to replace this year s mtv asia music award. mtv s asia aid will be held in bangkok on 3 february  and is aimed at helping to raise money for the asian tsunami disaster.,-2.8709698
126,tech,ibm frees 500 software patents computer giant ibm says 500 of its software patents will be released into the open development community.  the move means developers will be able to use the technologies without paying for a licence from the company. ibm described the step as a  new era  in how it dealt with intellectual property and promised further patents would be made freely available. the patents include software for a range of practices  including text recognition and database management. traditional technology business policy is to amass patents and despite ibm s announcement the company continues to follow this route.  ibm was granted 3 248 patents in 2004  more than any other firm in the us  the new york times reports. for each of the past 12 years ibm has been granted more us patents than any other company. ibm has received 25 772 us patents in that period and reportedly has more than 40 000 current patents. in a statement  dr john e. kelly  ibm senior vice president  technology and intellectual property  said:  true innovation leadership is about more than just the numbers of patents granted. it s about innovating to benefit customers  partners and society.   our pledge today is the beginning of a new era in how ibm will manage intellectual property.  in the past  ibm has supported the non-commercial operating system linux although critics have said this was done only as an attempt to undermine microsoft.  the company said it wanted to encourage other firms to release patents into what it called a  patent commons . adam jollans  ibm s world-wide linux strategy manager  said the move was a genuine attempt to encourage innovation.  we believe that releasing these patents will result in innovation moving more quickly.  this is about encouraging collaboration and following a model much like academia.  mr jollans likened the plan for a patent commons to the way the internet was developed and said everyone could take advantage of the result of collaboration.  the internet s impact has been on everyone. the benefits are there for everyone to take advantage of.  stuart cohen  chief executive of us firm open source development labs  said the move could mean a change in the way companies deal with patents.   i think other companies will follow suit   he said. but not everyone was as supportive. florian mueller  campaign manager of a group lobbying toprevent software patents becoming legal in the european union dismissed ibm s move as insubstantial.  it s just diversionary tactics   wrote mr mueller  who leadsnosoftwarepatents.com  in a message on the group s website.  let s put this into perspective: we re talking aboutroughly one percent of ibm s worldwide patent portfolio. they filethat number of patents in about a month s time   he added. ibm will continue to hold the 500 patents but it has pledged to seek no royalties from the patents. the company said it would not place any restrictions on companies  groups or individuals who use them in open-source projects. open source software is developed by programmers who offer the source code - the origins of the program - for free and allow others to adapt or improve the software. end users have the right to modify and redistribute the software  as well as the right to package and sell the software. other areas covered by the patents released by ibm include storage management  simultaneous multiprocessing  image processing  networking and e-commerce.,-0.493515
252,politics,ukip candidate suspended in probe eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.  john houston  54  was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. but he was suspended after his reported views  including the return of the british empire  were sent to two scottish newspapers. ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views. the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip  soon after the high-profile departure of mep robert kilroy-silk. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be  made available to law-abiding members of the community  and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. the document reportedly said:  we re looking for the resurrection of the british empire.  the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale  and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations  which they are uniquely able to do.  mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston s reported views had been presented as ukip policy  which they were not. he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party s manifesto  but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate. he told bbc news:  he appears to have said these things. we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate.  by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting.  it is simply a distraction from the task in hand  the eu constitution  not individual idiocies.  mr houston was quoted in the herald newspaper saying:  i feel ukip have over-reacted and overshot the runway.   peter nielson  who is ukip scotland chairman  said he had suspended mr houston on friday night.  he will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken.  he said that any evidence would be looked into and mr houston may be interviewed by the party. he added:  i can t comment too much at the moment  i have one version from him but i haven t seen the papers yet.,0.961812

1486,sport,wenger rules out new keeper arsenal boss arsene wenger says he has no plans to sign a new goalkeeper during the january transfer window.  wenger has brought in manuel almunia for the last three games for the out-of-form jens lehmann - but the spaniard himself has been prone to mistakes. there have been suggestions that wenger will swoop for a high-quality shot-stopper in the new year. but he told the evening standard:  i don t feel it will be necessary to bring in a new goalkeeper in january.  the gunners manager refused to comment on the difficult start that 27-year-old almunia has made to his career at highbury. and he would not be drawn on whether lehmann would return for the top-of-the table clash with chelsea on sunday.  almunia was at fault for rosenborg s goal in arsenal s 5-1 champions league win on tuesday and had some hairy moments in last week s win over birmingham. but wenger said earlier this week that his indifferent form was down to pressure caused by being under scrutiny from the media.  the debate has gone on too long. everyone has an opinion and i do not have to add to it   wenger added. arsenal have been linked with middlesbrough keeper mark schwarzer  fulham s edwin van der sar and parma s sebastien frey. and wenger has no immediate plans to recall former england under-21 international stuart taylor from his loan spell at leicester.,1.8180752
293,politics,tory  stalking horse  meyer dies sir anthony meyer  the tory backbencher who challenged margaret thatcher for the party leadership in 1989  has died.  he was 84  had been suffering from cancer for many months  and died at his london home. that failed  stalking horse  leadership challenge made it easier for michael heseltine to mount his own bid. that in turn paved the way for john major to move into 10 downing street  after the second ballot. meyer s constituency party  clwyd north west  which he had represented as an mp for more than 20 years  deselected him as a result of that challenge. sir anthony john charles meyer was born on 27 october  1920. educated at eton  and at new college  oxford  he served in the scots guards from 1941 to 1945 and was wounded in tanks in normandy. he worked under edward heath on europe at the foreign office and subsequently won the eton and slough seat for the tories in 1964 - by 11 votes. labour regained the seat two years later  and meyer had to wait until 1970 before he could re-enter parliament. his prospects of a front bench slot remained remote because he tended to defy the party line.,1.0323453
2085,tech,mobile games come of age the bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing. a brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below.  if you think of snake when some mentions  mobile games  then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time. even before nokia s n-gage game phone launched in late 2003  many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset.  and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market. that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home  game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can. life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed. now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than 200 different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste. there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders  lunar lander and bejewelled. there are also versions of titles  such as colin mcrae rally  that you typically find on pcs and consoles.  there are shoot-em-ups  adventure games  strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets. rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film  understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost £5. what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push. by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals. the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too. almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3d graphics.  the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. many titles  particularly racing games  let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a  ghost  or  shadow  to see if you can beat them. a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or  if you are sitting close to them  via bluetooth short-range radio technology. with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing.   too fast too furious (digital bridges)   as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games - because i m rubbish at them. no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. winning gives you cash for upgrades. graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play.   fatal force (macrospace)   a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth. graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. both background music and sounds effects work well. the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders. weapons include flamethrowers  rocket launchers  grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. with the right power-up you can go into a matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range. online the game has quite a following with clans  player rankings and even new downloadable maps.,-0.0692873

1937,politics,howard denies split over id cards michael howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial labour plans to introduce id cards.  the tory leader said his front bench team had reached a  collective view  after holding a  good discussion   but admitted it was  not an easy issue . he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror  crime and illegal immigration. the lib dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next monday.  tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the id card scheme. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis  oliver letwin and tim yeo. but mr howard denied mr yeo  his transport and environment spokesman  said the plans  stink . he also said he was confident shadow home secretary mr davis would  set out the position very clearly  when he stands up to debate the matter next week. mr howard said the police had said id cards could  help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives . he added:  when the police say that you have to take them seriously .  he acknowledged there were  good libertarian arguments  against the cards  but said the shadow cabinet had weighed up all the  conflicting interests  before reaching its decision.  i don t pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.  he also denied he was afraid of looking  soft  on the issue  compared to labour. the conservatives announced their support for the government plans on monday evening.  sources within the party told the bbc mr howard had always been in favour of id cards  and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. but the tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.  they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would be able to deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people s privacy would be properly protected.  it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect   a spokesman said. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten has branded the id scheme a waste of money and  deeply flawed . he said:  this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues  concerns over id cards.   the chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.  tory ex-minister douglas hogg said he opposed the plans for id cards branding them a  regressive  step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. he predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of britain s ethnic minorities being stopped by police.,5.1718674

2094,tech,cyber crime booms in 2004 the last 12 months have seen a dramatic growth in almost every security threat that plague windows pcs.  the count of known viruses broke the 100 000 barrier and the number of new viruses grew by more than 50%. similarly phishing attempts  in which conmen try to trick people into handing over confidential data  are recording growth rates of more than 30% and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. also on the increase are the number of networks of remotely controlled computers  called bot nets  used by malicious hackers and conmen to carry out many different cyber crimes.  one of the biggest changes of 2004 was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast-spreading virus  said kevin hogan  senior manager in symantec s security response group. although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code  said mr hogan  2004 saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs. the financial incentives were driving criminal use of technology  he said. his comment was echoed by graham cluley  senior technology consultant from anti-virus firm sophos. mr cluley said:  when the commercial world gets involved  things really get nasty. virus writers and hackers will be looking to make a tidy sum.   in particular  phishing attacks  which typically use fake versions of bank websites to grab login details of customers  boomed during 2004. web portal lycos europe reported a 500% increase in the number of phishing e-mail messages it was catching. the anti-phishing working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of 30% or more per month. those who fall victim to these attacks can find that their bank account has been cleaned out or that their good name has been ruined by someone stealing their identity. this change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass-mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e-mail messages.  they are not an efficient way of spreading viruses   said mr hogan.  they are very noisy and they are not technically challenging.  the opening months of 2004 did see the appearance of the netsky  bagle and mydoom mass mailers  but since then more surreptitious viruses  or worms  have dominated.  mr hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting pcs to take part in  bot nets  that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites.  in september symantec released statistics which showed that the numbers of active  bot computers  rose from 2 000 to 30 000 per day. thanks to these  bot nets   spam continued to be a problem in 2004. anti-spam firms report that  in many cases  legitimate e-mail has shrunk to less than 30% of messages. part of the reason that these  bot nets  have become so prevalent  he said  was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created. in the past many viruses  such as netsky  have been the work of an individual or group. by contrast  said mr hogan  the code for viruses such as gaobot  spybot and randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time. the result is that now there are more than 3 000 variations of the spybot worm.  that s unprecedented   said mr hogan.  what makes it difficult is that they are all co-existing with each other and do not exist in an easy to understand chronology.   the emergence of the first proper virus for mobile phones was also seen in 2004.  in the past  threats to smart phones have been largely theoretical because the viruses created to cripple phones existed only in the laboratory rather than the wild. in june  the cabir virus was discovered that can hop from phone to phone using bluetooth short-range radio technology. also released this year was the mosquito game for symbian phones which surreptitiously sends messages to premium rate numbers  and in november the skulls trojan came to light which can cripple phones. on the positive side  finnish security firm f-secure said that 2004 was the best-ever year for the capture  arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally-minded hackers. in total  eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so-called 29a virus writing group were sentenced. one high-profile arrest was that of german teenager sven jaschen who confessed to be behind the netsky and sasser virus families. also shut down were the carderplanet and shadowcrew websites that were used to trade stolen credit card numbers.,-0.36628246
1204,politics,at a glance: tory health checks the uk  opposition conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the general election. here s a guide to the plan:  people coming to live and work in britain from outside the eu. if they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of tb  they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. all people from outside the european union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical.  tuberculosis  hepatitis b and hiv. a positive test for tb would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. all other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis.  people would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the uk  or impose significant costs or demands on the nhs. they would also  if appropriate  have to be able to undertake the work or study they applied to come here for.  people coming to britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care  childcare or teaching. children and pregnant women wanting to live in britain permanently would not have to have a chest x-ray for tb. under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and hiv.  the tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in britain because of poor health. however  they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases.  they claim government figures show that tb in england has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas. they also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into britain to ensure they are not a public health risk. they say the plans will protect access to the nhs.  applicants will be tested in their home country. only asylum seekers will be tested in the uk once their refugee status is established.  home office minister des browne says the government already routinely checks people for tb if they come into the uk for six months or more from high-risk countries. recent medical checks were carried out on 175 000 people at heathrow airport and 10 000 at gatwick. from those tests  about 100 infectious cases of tb were found.  the tories say 47 other countries across the world impose requirements of this kind. the party has looked at the way the system is operated in australia  canada and new zealand. the tory proposals are  quite closely modelled  on the new zealand system.  labour claims the policy is little more than a  desperate attempt to catch up with labour s five-year plan  for immigration and asylum  which was published last week. this says health screening for tb will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance. those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the uk. the liberal democrats have warned labour and the tories they were  in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it .,-0.7079387

1945,business,brazil approves bankruptcy reform a major reform of brazil s bankruptcy laws has been approved by the country s congress  in a move which it is hoped will cut the cost of borrowing.  the bill  proposed in 1993  has finally been approved by the leadership of president luiz inacio lula da silva. the old law  dating from 1945  gave priority first to workers  second to tax revenue and finally to creditors. the new legislation changes this  giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers. the new regulations will limit payments to workers to 150 times the minimum monthly salary  which is currently $94. the law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy. however  when a firm is declared bankrupt it will gain protection from creditors for 180 days while a recovery plan is worked out.  the proposals were opposed in the past by leftist parties  including mr lula s worker party. they considered that they undermined workers  rights. but president lula became a defender of the reforms  arguing that the country s bank lending margins were among the highest in the world and were damaging the economy. according to andreas adriano of latin trade magazine  the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds. nevertheless  mr adriano said to reduce the basic interest rate the central bank needs to change its policy  focusing not only on inflation but also on economic growth.,-2.3573594

2132,tech,what s next for next-gen consoles  the next generation of video games consoles are in development but what will the new machines mean for games firms and consumers  we may not know when they will be released  what they will be called or even what they will be able to do but one thing is certain - they are coming. sony  microsoft and nintendo are all expected to release new machines in the next 18 months. the details of playstation 3  xbox 2 (codename xenon) and nintendo s so-called revolution are still to be finalised but developers are having to work on titles for the new machines regardless.   we know maybe what the ps3 will do  but we can only guess   said rory armes  studio general manager for video game giant electronic arts in europe.  it s a horrendous effort in the first year   he admitted. microsoft had delivered development kits to ea  said mr armes  but he said the company was still waiting on sony and nintendo to send kits. although the details may not be nailed down  mr armes said ea was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines.  the rumours are that playstation 3 will have a little more under the hood [than xbox 2]   he said.   microsoft is obviously a software company first and foremost  while sony has more experience in hardware. i think sony will be able to push more into a box at cost.   what is certain is that the new machines will provide great leaps in processing and graphical power. it is also likely that they will contain convergence technologies to make the machines more of an entertainment hub. at the consumer electronics show in las vegas microsoft boss bill gates said xbox 2 would be part of his vision of the digital lifestyle. while short on detail  he painted a picture of a machine that would complement a pc and offer  great video gaming but video gaming for a broader set of people  more communications  more media  more connectivity . sony is thought to have a similar vision for ps3 while nintendo remain focused on a machine purely for games.  until it is clear precisely what the new machines can do  developers are working on a first round of titles to harness the new horsepower. gary dunn  development director at codemasters  said the company had a central technology group which was at the forefront of preparing for the next generation of consoles.  we are working on new libraries of effects. a lot of the major techniques are already out there and in use in pc gaming  such as pixel shaders and normal mapping.   mr dunn said he expected the introduction of real-world physics to be a major part of the new consoles.  we want to increase that level of immersion and realism in gaming to people can lose themselves in a game.  in the first year at least  developers said gamers should not expect games which harness the full potential of the machines. graphical spit and polish and better physics in line with the capabilities of current high-end graphics cards for pcs should be expected. simon gardner  president of climax s action studio  said:  it s definitely an exciting time. we want to give more freedom to the player. we want to give players an emotional connection to the characters they play.  the environments will be much more believable and dramatic  growing and changing as you play.  there will be a breadth of effects  more involving worlds to play in.   it s a bit like being an artist and being given a bigger canvas and a smaller brush. we re being given more tools.  for the average consumer  we can get things of a more filmic quality.  gerhard florin  head of ea in europe  said gamers should expect titles that blur the line between films and video games. many will be sceptical - gamers were given similar predictions during the last transition of console hardware - but this time it would seem to be more likely.  ps3 will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies   said mr florin. he said the distribution method for games would also change radically in the next round of consoles.  a gamer could buy a starter disc for 10 euros. when he goes home he goes online and he could buy ai and levels as you go.   it s much smarter if you can get levels as you go.  mr armes warned that developers still had to learn how to tell stories effectively in the medium.  in some ways we are trying to forget about the hardware  go in the opposite direction. we have been very bad at letting technology design our creativity.  what we have to do as a company is start ignoring the technology and learning our craft in telling stories.  mr gardner agreed:  we can thrown more polygons around and have better ai but if it doesn t make for a better game then that s not very useful.  developers will certainly have the tools with the new machines  but how they employ them is still to be decided.,-1.3220477

1514,tech,apple laptop is  greatest gadget  the apple powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time  by us magazine mobile pc.  the 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first  lightweight  portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs. the magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets  which includes the sony walkman at number three and the 1956 zenith remote control at two. gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. the magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadgets also needed to be a  self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own  not a subset of another device .   in general we included only items that were potentially mobile   said the magazine.   in the end  we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget   it concluded. the oldest  gadget  in the top 100 is the abacus  which the magazine dates at 190 a.d.  and put in 60th place. other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position)  the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the kodak brownie camera from 1900 (28th position). the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10  which also includes the first flash mp3 player (diamond multimedia)  as well as the first  successful  digital camera (casio qv-10) and mobile phone (motorola startac). the most popular gadget of the moment  the apple ipod  is at number 12 in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number 13.  sony s third entry in the top 20 is the cdp-101 cd player from 1983.  who can forget the crystalline  hiss-free blast of madonna s like a virgin emanating from their first cd player   asked the magazine. karl elsener s knife  the swiss army knife from 1891  is at number 20 in the list. gadgets which could be said to feature surprisingly low down in the list include the original telephone (23rd)  the nintendo gameboy (25th)  and the pulsar quartz digital watch (36th). the list also contains plenty of oddities: the pez sweet dispenser (98th)  1990s toy tamagotchi (86th) and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (84th).  almost everyone has a mobile phone  how many people own a powerbook  or an ipod  the findings of this magazine are not very convincing.  what about the magnetic compass  we still use it 1 000 years after it was invented.  i am amazed by the obsession with individual gadgets rather than genre. for example the sony walkman was the first truly portable way of listening to your own music on the move whereas minidisc  flash mp3  portable cd players etc. are really just improvements in technology.  my favourite  true  gadgets are probably my portable minidisc player and the little battery powered whizzy thing i use to froth up my coffee!  calm down it s only in their opinion  and any list that includes the taser in the top 100 gadgets has to be suspect....  swiss army knife and no question about it. how many of the other items are still relatively unchanged from the original idea and still as useful/popular  you don t need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out!  this list merely illustrates interesting cultural divides between the american authors and the overwhelmingly british responses. brits see no further than mobile phones and the over thirties sinclair; whilst the americans focus on apple  tv remotes and tivo (which probably is rather obscure in europe).  what about the soda stream. this gadget changed my pre-teen life. lap tops may enable you to  think different  but you cant use them to  get busy with the fizzy   how about astro wars  one of the pioneers for computer games  i remember spending many an hour playing this and it still works today! however tried it the other day and it was rubbish  still a great gadget of its time.  why worry about mobile phones. soon they will be subsumed into the pda s / laptops etc.  what about the marine chronometer  completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. for it s time  a technological marvel!  sony net minidisc! it paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. i always used my netmd  and could not go anywhere without it.  a laptop computer is not a gadget! it s a working tool!  the sinclair executive was the world s first pocket calculator. i think this should be there as well.  how about the clockwork radio  or gps  or a pocket calculator  all these things are useful to real people  not just pc magazine editors.  are the people who created this list insane   surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone  it has revolutionised communication  which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. from outside the modern age  the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget  without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly.  has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker    an interesting list. of the electronic gadgets  thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the tandy 100. the size of a4 paper and light  three weeks on a set of batteries  an excellent keyboard  a modem. a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible.  what s an apple powerbook 100   it s out of date - not much of a  gadget . surely it has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener  swiss army knife  safety razor blade  wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves    it has to be the mobile phone. no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time.  the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule.  the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980. a true gadget  it could be carried around and shown off.  all top 10 are electronic toys  so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anything else. i say this as the swiss army knife only made no 20.  sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time. the first home machine with a true multi-takings os. shame the marketing was so bad!!!  apple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else.  utter rubbish. yes  the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets. but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer  gadgets  and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. no competition.  i d also put apple s newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing  and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason. i only wish that vulcan inc s flipstart wasn t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top.  how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)  what about radios and tvs   the swiss army knife. by far the most useful gadget. i got mine 12 years ago. still wearing and using it a lot! it stood the test of time.  psion organiser series 3  should be up there. had a usable qwerty keyboard  removable storage  good set of apps and programmable. case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first  i think). great product innovation.  the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile pc ! why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site  it s obviously the mobile phone or remote control  and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that.  the motorola startac should be number one. why  there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices.  the psion series 3c! the first most practical way to carry all your info around...  i too would back the sinclair spectrum - without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now.  i d have put the mobile phone high up the list. probably a nokia model.  sinclair spectrum - 16k. it plugged into the tv. games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that s what i do for a living now.  i wish more modern notebooks -- even apple s newest offerings -- were more like the pb100. particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball  which has given way to the largely useless  trackpad  which every notebook on the market today uses. they re invariably inaccurate  uncomfortable  and cumbersome to use.  congratulations to apple  a deserved win!,4.0571284

290,business,yukos seeks court action on sale yukos will return to a us court on wednesday to seek sanctions against baikal finance group  the little-known firm which has bought its main asset.  yukos has said it will sue baikal and others involved in the sale of yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages. yukos  us lawyers will attempt to have baikal assets frozen after the russian government ignored a us court order last week blocking the sale. baikal s background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear.  russian newspapers have claimed that baikal - which bought the yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles  £4.8bn) on sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with surgutneftegas  russia s fourth-biggest oil producer. many observers believe that the unit  which produces 60% of yukos  oil output  could ultimately fall into the hands of surgutneftegas or even gazprom  the state gas firm which opted out of the auction.  the russian government forced the sale of yukos  most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a $27bn back tax bill it says the company owes. yukos  us lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of us bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction. on wednesday  yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group.  we believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us   yukos spokesman mike lake told agence france press.  if it exports that oil  it will be marketing a stolen product   he added. the future ownership of yuganksneftegas remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that baikal was established as a front for other interests.  speaking on tuesday  president putin said baikal was owned by individual investors who planned to build relationships with other russian energy firms interested in the development of yuganskneftegas. president putin also suggested that china s national petroleum corporation could play a role in the unit s future after signing a commercial agreement with gazprom to work on joint energy projects. yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company. commentators and yukos itself claim the firm is the target of a government campaign to destroy it because of the political ambitions of its founder  mikhail khodorkovsky.,0.7085228

1357,tech,bond game fails to shake or stir for gaming fans  the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of 1995  but also the classic shoot-em-up that accompanied it and left n64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour.  adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game  for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original s massive sense of fun. this however is not a sequel  nor does it relate to the goldeneye film. you are the eponymous renegade spy  an agent who deserts to the bond world s extensive ranks of criminal masterminds  after being deemed too brutal for mi6. your new commander-in-chief is the portly auric goldfinger  last seen in 1964  but happily running around bent on world domination. with a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of tina turner s similarly-titled theme song  the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury  which enables a degree of x-ray vision.  rogue agent signals its intentions by featuring james bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments  squashed by a plummeting helicopter. the notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a 007 game  but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to.  recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair  invention and glamour of the film franchise. this title lacks that aura  and when the bond magic shines through  it feels like a lucky accident. the central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough. quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump  the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy ai  the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination. admittedly the competition has been tough  even in recent weeks  with the likes of halo 2 and half life 2 triumphing in virtually every department. what the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy  dynamic scenes of violent chaos. as is the trend of late  you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter. sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos  meaning that frustration is often the outcome. and irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed. a minute red dot passes for a crosshair  although the collision-detection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for. shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky  and you will not always know you have picked them off  since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor  and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations. it is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game maker s allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights - no time is risked with a measured build-up.  by far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like dr no  goldfinger  hat-fiend oddjob and crazed russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrected after all these years  and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion.  there is a real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains  and it is a testament to the power of the bond universe that they can cut such a dash. but the in-game niggles  combined with a story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thought-through  will make this a disappointment for most. diehard fans of bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings. the game is weak  not completely unplayable. then again  007 fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras. given james bond s healthy pedigree in past games  there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip  a commendable idea that just has not worked  that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return.  goldeneye: rogue agent is out now,-4.9647694

2050,business,novartis hits acquisition trail swiss drugmaker novartis has announced 5.65bn euros ($7.4bn; £3.9bn) of purchases to make its sandoz unit the world s biggest generic drug producer.  novartis  which last month forecast record sales for 2005  said it had bought all of germany s hexal. it also acquired 67.7% of hexal s us affiliate eon labs  and offered to buy the remaining shares for $31 each. novartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about $200m a year following the acquisitions. novartis  shares rose 1% to 57.85 swiss francs in early trading.  the deal will see novartis  sandoz business overtake israel s teva pharmaceuticals as the world s biggest maker of generics. based on 2004 figures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than $5bn  the company estimated. novartis said that it would merge a number of departments  adding that there may be job cuts.   the strong growth outlook for sandoz  which will create jobs  is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force   the firm said in a statement. generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals. producers such as sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost.  there are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented. however  not all analysts were initially convinced about the deal.  this is a very expensive acquisition   birgit kuhlhoff  from sal oppenheim investment bank  told reuters.  i find it strange that they are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure.,1.1430192

417,business,firms pump billions into pensions employers have spent billions of pounds propping up their final salary pensions over the past year  research suggests.  a survey of 280 schemes by incomes data services  (ids) said employer contributions had increased from £5.5bn to £8.2bn a year  a rise of 49.7%. companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by 100% or more  ids said. many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open  because of rising costs and increased liabilities. a final salary scheme  also known as a defined benefit scheme  promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire.  the rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase  or defined contribution  schemes. these are less risky for employers. under money purchase schemes  employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity - a policy which pays out an income until death - on retirement.  ids said there were some schemes in good health.  but  in many cases  firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle  yawning deficits . the level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late 1990s. in 1998/99  for example  contributions rose by 4.7% and in 2002/03 by 8.6%. in contrast  between 1996 and 1998  some employers cut their contribution levels. helen sudell  editor of the ids pensions service  said the rise in contributions was  staggering  and the highest ever recorded by ids.  we have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision   said ms sudell.  with figures like this there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes.,-0.12929773

941,tech,cheaper chip for mobiles a mobile phone chip which combines a modem and a computer processor on one bit of silicon instead of two could make phones cheaper and more powerful.  the specially-designed chip  developed by texas instruments  could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of 3d gaming and 30-frame-a-second video. currently  rich multimedia features tend to be on more expensive handsets. the technology  omap-vox  is being tested by firms in europe and asia and could appear by the end of the year. texas  which makes computer chips for more than half the world s mobile phones  said it was keen to make multimedia functions like video and gaming more affordable.  we re going to drive them down into meat-and-potatoes phones that have the largest market share   said doug rasor  a marketing vice president at texas. the chip also uses much less power than conventional chips  said texas  which means less strain on mobile battery life.  more than 50 million people own a mobile in the uk  but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more. texas is keen to cash in on the third generation (3g) of mobile technology  which offers high-speed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions. but it faces stiff competition from the likes of intel which is also looking to provide better chips for high-end mobiles.  competition to get people using 3g mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the uk s operators have now launched third generation networks. a recent survey by sony ericsson predicted that the number of 3g handsets sold in 2005 would double from 2004 to account for 10% of all phones sold. many consumers are still to be convinced though. a further recent survey said that only 4% of mobile owners were thinking of upgrading to 3g phones. many said they were confused about the different ways to pay for phones and the vast array of features most have onboard.  but there will be continued demand for better chips as the industry continues to develop new standards and future networks. earlier in january  ntt docomo and vodafone joined forces to develop the next generation of high-speed networks  known as  super 3g   intended to be 10 times faster than 3g services. the first stage of development is to be completed by 2007  but no date has been set for a commercial launch the newly-designed omap-vox chip set was announced ahead of the start of a major mobile industry conference  3gsm  which takes place in cannes  france this week.,0.35210752

853,business,uk economy ends year with spurt the uk economy grew by an estimated 3.1% in 2004 after accelerating in the last quarter of the year  says the office for national statistics (ons).  the figure is in line with treasury and bank of england forecasts. the ons says gross domestic product (gdp) rose by a strong 0.7% in the three months to 31 december  compared with 0.5% in the previous quarter. the rise came despite a further decline in production output and the worst christmas for retailers in decades.  the annual figure marked out the best year since 2000  and was also well ahead of the 2.2% recorded in 2003. growth in the final three months of 2004 marked the 50th consecutive quarter of expansion.  on the basis of the latest information the uk has entered 2005 on course to continue its record period of growth   said paul boateng  chief secretary to the treasury in a statement.  the ons said the services sector  which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the uk economy  grew 1.0% in the quarter. the strong services figure was welcomed by analysts  given lacklustre retail sales in december and across the christmas holiday period.  the fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend (growth) and i am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown   said ross walker  uk economist at rbs financial markets.  however  output in the production sector contracted 0.5%  the second quarterly fall in row and a state of affairs that some economists classify as a recession. however the ons would not comment on the definition of a recession and whether the manufacturing recovery was over. but steve radley  chief economist at the manufacturers  organisation eef  said:  these figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground.  whilst companies may be experiencing tougher conditions this year   recession  is not a word that manufacturers would currently recognise.  the ons said a sharp fall in mining and quarrying  which was driven by oil and gas extraction  was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures.  simon rubinsohn  chief economist at gerrard  said:  this outturn (of 0.7%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the uk economy.  and he said the gdp figures may help to  push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve .  the suggestion from the money markets is that the next move is now more likely to be in an upward rather than a downward direction. this is consistent with our own thinking   said mr rubinsohn. the bank of england s nine-strong rate-setting committee voted unanimously earlier this month to keep interest rates steady at 4.75%  minutes of the meeting showed on wednesday.,0.90340614
383,entertainment,brando  rejected godfather role  late film star marlon brando is said to have repeatedly turned down his oscar-winning role in the godfather.  the actor s friend budd schulberg told vanity fair magazine that brando s assistant suggested he read the novel. the actor repeatedly refused  throwing the book at her and saying:  for the last time  i won t glorify the mafia . but brando  who died last july at the age of 80  eventually took the role of don corleone  winning him an oscar in 1973 which he notoriously refused. the actor sent a young woman dressed in native american costume to refuse the award on his behalf and to draw attention to the plight of native americans.  schulberg told the magazine that brando s assistant realised the film star had warmed to the idea of the godfather role when he sported a drawn-on pencil moustache and asked:  how do i look   his assistant  alice marchak  said that he looked like george raft  an actor famed for playing gangsters on the silver screen. every time she went to see brando from then on  she added  he was wearing a different gangster-style moustache. brando was asked to screen test for the role in the godfather  as studio executives were said to be reluctant for the actor to play the part following problems on the set of brando s previous film mutiny on the bounty . in fact brando s academy award triumph revived his career. the actor was nominated for an oscar the following year for his role in bernardo bertolucci s last tango in paris. before his death  brando granted gaming company electronic arts the rights to use his voice and image in a video game based on the godfather film and book and recorded voice-overs which closely resembled his role as don corleone. brando s co-stars from the godfather  james caan and robert duvall  will also reprise their roles for the video game  it was confirmed on wednesday.,-2.3799396

542,politics,act on detention ruling  uk urged the government must act quickly on the law lords  ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful  mary robinson has said.  the former un commissioner for human rights and irish president told radio 4 s today the government s response would be scrutinised internationally.  it would be very troubling if the government did not accept the judgement and then work within it   she said. home secretary charles clarke has said detainees will not be freed at present. speaking to parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following david blunkett s resignation  mr clarke said:  i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year.  in the meantime  we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords.   mrs robinson said the law lords  ruling was  in line with international legal opinion  and praised their  very decisive  eight to one majority.  what the law lords did was acknowledge the role of the government  but say that there had been a disproportionate use  that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn t apply to british citizens   she said.  mrs robinson warned that a lack of action by the british government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the european court of human rights in strasbourg.  if the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress  including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the law lords.  she said a meeting of the club of madrid - a group of former world leaders - to be held in the spanish capital on the march anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications.  i have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at  both as a very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles  but also the response of the british government will be under quite a clear international scrutiny there.   the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office s powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us. any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. the law lords said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions  in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status . the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case.,0.4042678

428,business,china suspends 26 power projects china has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations  including two at the three gorges dam  on environmental grounds.  the move is a surprising one because china is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. the state environmental protection agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper yangtze river.  construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first  approval next   said sepa vice-director pan yue  in a statement on the agency s website.  some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits  but others would be cancelled  he said. altogether  the agency ordered 30 projects halted. other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in fujian. the bulk of the list was made up of new power plants  with some extensions to existing ones. the stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government s battle to control projects licensed by local officials. however  previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity  such as steel and cement. the government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. in 2004  china increased its generating capacity by 12.6%  or 440 700 megawatts (mw). the biggest single project to be halted was the xiluodi dam project  designed to produce 12 600 mw of electricity. it is being built on the jinshajiang - or  river of golden sand  as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known. second and third on the agency s list were two power stations being built at the $22bn three gorges dam project on the central yangtze - an underground 4 200 mw power plant and a 100 mw plant.  the three gorges dam has proved controversial in china - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. it has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. the damming of the upper yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in china. in april 2004  central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby nu river  which is part of a united nations world heritage site  the three parallel rivers site which covers the yangtze  mekong and nu (also known as the salween)  according to the uk-published china review. that move reportedly followed a protest from the thai government about the downstream impact of the dams  and a critical documentary made by chinese journalists. china s energy shortage influenced global prices for oil  coal and shipping last year.,1.4097805

1244,business,uk house prices dip in november uk house prices dipped slightly in november  the office of the deputy prime minister (odpm) has said.  the average house price fell marginally to £180 226  from £180 444 in october. recent evidence has suggested that the uk housing market is slowing after interest rate increases  and economists forecast a drop in prices during 2005. but while the monthly figures may hint at a cooling of the market  annual house price inflation is still strong  up 13.8% in the year to november. economists  however  forecast that odpm figures are likely to show a weakening in annual house price growth in coming months.  overall  the housing market activity is slowing down and that is backed up by the mortgage lending and the mortgage approvals data   said mark miller  at hbos treasury services.  the odpm data is a fairly lagging indicator.   the figures come after the bank of england said the number of mortgages approved in the uk has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade. the halifax  meanwhile  said last week that house prices increased by 1.1% in december - the first monthly rise since september.  the uk s biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1% over the whole of 2004  but by only 2.8% in the second half of the year. it is predicting a 2% fall in overall prices in 2005 as the market stabilises after large gains in recent years. the odpm attributed the monthly fall of prices in november to a drop in the value of detached houses and flats. it said annual inflation rose between october and november because prices had fallen by 1.1% in the same period in 2003.  the odpm data showed the average house price was £192 713 in england; £139 544 in wales; £116 542 in scotland  and £111 314 in northern ireland.  all areas saw a rise in annual house price inflation in november except for northern ireland and the west midlands  where the rate was unchanged  the odpm said. the north east showed the highest rate of inflation at 26.2%  followed by yorkshire and the humber on 21.7%  and the north west on 21.1%. the east midlands  the west midlands and the south west all had an annual inflation rate of more than 15%. in london  the area with the highest average house price at £262 825  annual inflation rose only slightly in november to 7.1% from 7% the previous month.,2.198537

2189,tech,mobile networks seek turbo boost third-generation mobile (3g) networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services.  that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3gsm world congress in cannes last week. fast 3g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service  says the global mobile suppliers association. at 3gsm  siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3g networks. the system is not available commercially yet  but motorola  the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker  held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa (high speed downlink packet access)  a high-speed  high bandwidth technology available now. early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second (mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobits per second (kbps) on standard 3g networks.   high-speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) - sometimes called super 3g - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips   according to a report published by uk-based research consultancy analysys. a number of companies are developing the technology. nokia and canada-based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access. the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers.   while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14mbps  practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks   said dr alastair brydon  author of the analysys report: pushing beyond the limits of 3g with hsdpa and other enhancements.  the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which  even at this lower rate  will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic wcdma [3g]   he added. motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3g cell using a single hsdpa device. but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution  data optimised (ev-do).  us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3g network at the end of last year. we are  expanding our network and deploying ev-do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds   said oliver valente  sprint s vice president for technology development  when the contract was announced. as part of $3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year  sprint will spend around $1bn on ev-do technology from lucent technologies  nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits a second  and peak download rates of 2.4mbps. mmo2  the uk-based operator with services in the uk  ireland and germany  has opted for technology based on hsdpa. using technology from lucent  it will offer data speeds of 3.6mbps from next summer on its isle of man 3g network  and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4mbps. us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa  using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson.  siemens  plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today  but christoph caselitz  president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that:  by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015  the need for transmission capacities for voice  data  image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10.  siemens - in collaboration with the fraunhofer german-sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae  instead of the usual one. this enables a data transmission  such as sending a big file or video  to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. the speeds offered by 3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences. but today  instead of connecting to the internet by slow  dial-up phone connection  many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second - much faster than 3g. this means users are likely to find 3g disappointing unless the networks are souped up. if they aren t  those lucrative  power users   such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks  reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators. but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately. siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory  it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials. a commercial system could be as far away as 2012  though siemens did not rule out an earlier date.,1.2866735
442,sport,scotland 18-10 italy six chris paterson penalties gave scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against italy at murrayfield.  coach matt williams  side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led 6-3 at the break. paterson slotted four more second-half penalties and scotland were denied a try when wing sean lamont s touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass. a late andrea masi try was small consolation for italy  chasing their first away win in the six nations. scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back paterson. but the more powerful azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life.  a series of drives into scottish territory set up a penalty attempt  missed by full-back roland de marigny  and a wayward drop-goal effort from luciano orquera. scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes italy  after coming up yards short of the line  equalised through a de marigny penalty. italy were offered another penalty when scottish flanker simon taylor was offside but the left-footed de marigny pushed his kick wide. scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the italian half and snatched three points from paterson when an italian forward handled the ball in a ruck.  as the half wore on  both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties  and the period fizzled out with scotland numerically  if not psychologically  on top. italy s de marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright. and scotland capitalised with a third paterson penalty on 50 minutes. williams  side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and  after a couple of probing attacks  paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap.  with the pendulum of possession swinging towards scotland  lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from paterson. another paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. but john kirwan s men had the last laugh when gordon ross  attempted clearance was charged down and masi pounced for the try  converted by de marigny.  : c paterson; s webster  a craig  h southwell  s lamont; d parks  c cusiter; t smith  g bulloch (capt)  g kerr; s grimes  s murray; s taylor  j petrie  a hogg.  r russell  b douglas  n hines  j dunbar  m blair  g ross  b hinshelwood.  r de marigny; mirco bergamasco  c stoica  a masi  l nitoglia; l orquera  a troncon; a lo cicero  f ongaro  m castrogiovanni; s dellape  m bortolami (capt); a persico  d dal maso  s parisse.  g intoppa  s perugini  ca del fava  s orlando  p griffen  r pedrazzi  kp robertson.,-0.2631836

316,business,takeover offer for sunderland fc bob murray  chairman of sunderland fc  has launched a £1.5m ($2.8m) bid for the club after buying broadcaster bskyb s stake in the business.  mr murray is already sunderland s leading shareholder  holding a 37.6% stake  and now hopes to take full control of the championship side. mr murray said the club would find it easier to attract more investment by having a single majority owner. sunderland delisted its shares from the stock market in august.  a lifetime sunderland supporter and board director since 1984  mr murray agreed to buy bskyb s 4.76% holding in the wearside club on tuesday - taking his stake to 42.3%. under stock market rules  mr murray is required to make an offer for the remaining shares that he does not already own at the same price paid for the bskyb holding of 31p a share.  should the offer be fully accepted  mr murray said he expected to pay a maximum of £1.53m for the remaining shares. he also stressed that fans who wanted to keep in touch with the club s financial affairs could retain a small number of shares  enabling them to attend annual meetings.  the football sector is experiencing significant changes and uncertainty   mr murray said in a statement.  the recent speculation surrounding malcolm glazer and manchester united has shown the unsettling effect possible where there are a number of disparate interests   he added.  i believe that this offer will strengthen the company and remove the potential for that type of uncertainty.   sunderland were relegated from the premiership in 2003 but are currently pushing for promotion. the club managed to reduce its losses last year from £20.6m to £1.2m after selling a host of leading players. however  the club s turnover dropped sharply from £42.5m to £28.5m over the same period  because of a fall in broadcast revenues. bskyb bought its stake in sunderland in 1999 as part of a five year media partnership deal. the deal expired last month.,0.039386272

660,politics,uk needs tax cuts  tories insist a major change of direction is needed in britain if it is to prosper  the shadow chancellor said as the tory party spring conference began.  oliver letwin said the uk could not compete with other countries without the £4bn tax cuts he was promising. tory co-chairman liam fox had opened the forum in brighton with an attack on labour s record and party leader michael howard is due to speak later. tony blair has said conservative policies would cause economic failure. but mr letwin said britain had fallen from fourth to 11th in the international economic competitiveness league.   can this country compete  can this country prosper  unless we do something about the burden of regulation and tax on our economy   he said.  if we are going to take on the great challenges  the challenges like those posed by the chinese and the indians  we have got to do something about getting down the burden of regulation and getting down the burden of tax   he said.  the fact is the very carefully costed  fully funded plans we have laid out for saving £12bn by 2007-2008 are absolutely crucial to delivering an economy that will prosper and provide people with jobs and indeed provide the public services with the money they need on a sustainable long-term basis.  mr letwin said voting for labour meant choosing higher taxes  borrowing and waste.  earlier  dr fox had said labour s rule had been characterised by  lost trust and failure to deliver . he also attacked the government s  failure  to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the nhs  telling delegates labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. a tory government would sort out the  shambles  of immigration  put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools  he said. michael howard  who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on friday  will address them in a lunchtime speech. his welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in london to lead the party s opposition to the prevention of terrorism bill in its lengthy progress through parliament. the bill was finally passed on friday evening  after more than 30 hours of debate. mr howard is likely to defend his party s handling of the bill  which was only passed after the conservatives accepted prime minister tony blair s promise that mps would be able to review it within a year.,2.3947217
253,tech,first look at playstation 3 chip some details of the chip inside sony s playstation 3 have been revealed.  sony  ibm and toshiba have released limited data about the so-called cell chip that will be able to carry out trillions of calculations per second. the chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together. the playstation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch.  the three firms have been working on the chip since 2001 but before now few details have been released about how it might function. in a joint statement the three firms gave hints about how the chip will work but fuller details will be released in february next year at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco.  the three firms claim that the cell chip will be up to 10 times more powerful than existing processors. when put inside powerful computer servers  the cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations  or calculations  every second. the chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media. ibm said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the us. the first machines off the line using the cell processor will be computer workstations and servers. a working version of the ps3 is due to be shown off in may 2005 but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006. as well as being inside the playstation 3  the chip will also be used inside high-definition tvs and powerful computers.  in the future  all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network   said ken kutaragi  chief operating officer of sony.  current pc architecture is nearing its limits.,-1.5988946
1823,business,qantas considers offshore option australian airline qantas could transfer as many as 7 000 jobs out of its home country as it seeks to save costs  according to newspaper reports.  chief executive geoff dixon was quoted by the australian newspaper as saying the carrier could no longer afford to remain  all-australian . unions criticised the possible move - which may affect cabin and maintenance staff - saying qantas was profitable. more than 90% of the airline s staff are based in australia.  qantas confirmed it was looking at whether it might recruit and source products overseas - potentially through joint ventures - but said it would continue to create jobs in australia.  despite making a record australian dollars 648m ($492m) profit last year  qantas has argued that it needs to make considerable savings if it is to remain competitive.  we re going to have to get the lowest cost structure we can and that willmean sourcing things more and more from overseas   the newspaper quoted qantas chief executive geoff dixon as saying. early this year  qantas increased the number of flight attendants based in london from 370 to 870. if qantas were to follow the lead of other airlines moving staff  offshore  7 000 jobs could shift overseas  the newspaper reported. in a statement  qantas said it was looking to build its operations overseas. however  it stressed this would not result in large scale redundancies in its home market  where most of its 35 000 staff are employed.  we are totally committed to continuing to grow jobs in australia   mr dixon said.  we are  however  operating in a global market and there is no room for complacency simply because we are currently profitable and successful.   unions reacted angrily to the reported disclosure  arguing that qantas was profitable and did not need to take such action.  we could understand if qantas was a struggling airline about to go under   michael mijatov  international division secretary of the flight attendants association  told agence france presse.  qantas announced a record profit last year and is on course this year for an even greater profit so it is totally unnecessary.  in an effort to meet the challenge posed by low cost carriers  qantas sought a tie-up with air new zealand last year however  the deal was thrown out by the new zealand high court on competition grounds.,2.1732206
255,politics,mps criticise child access system divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system  mps have said.  the constitutional affairs select committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access. courts should be used as a last resort  but where they are  their orders should be enforced more rigorously  mps said. but they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access.  currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount.  an arbitrary  template  imposed on all families  whatever the needs of the child  would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position   the mps said.  they said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in contested cases. this would  reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children  as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents  while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety   they said. delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed  a new  status quo  arrangement for the children to become established by default   they said.   although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias  there are considerable grounds for accepting that non-resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present.  given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases  we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents.  committee chairman alan beith said the five-month inquiry had been a  complex and emotive  one.  at the moment  far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation   he said.  this situation has to change. the court system should only be used as a last resort  where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with.  this will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country.,1.8493795

1666,tech,games help you  learn and play   god games  in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational  says research.  a us researcher has suggested that games such as the sims could be a good way to teach languages. ravi purushotma believes that the world of the sims can do a better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods. the inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore  said mr purushotma.  there must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework. but instead of fearing computer games  ravi purushotma believes that educationalists  particularly language teachers should embrace games.  one goal would be to break what i believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional   he said. he believes that the  phenomenal ability  of games such as the sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation. the hard part of learning any language  said mr purushotma  were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences. boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be.  the way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity   he said.  by contrast  said mr purushotma  learning via something like the sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all. this was because the sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players. instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on. the incidental information about what a sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning  said mr purushotma. by contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context. for instance  he said  in a version of the sims adapted to teach german  if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word  energie  the actions of a tired sim  stumbling then falling asleep  would illustrate the meaning. if necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players  or students  understanding.  one of the drawbacks of the sims  said mr purushotma  was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation. however  online versions of the sims  in which people have to move in  meet the neighbours and get to know the local town  could be adapted to help this. although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn  mr purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help.  getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid  he believes. before now  he said  educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games. but  he said  using pre-prepared game worlds such as the sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game. this could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons.  i m hoping now to re-create a well-polished german learning mod for the sequel by this summer   he told the bbc news website.  i m encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with japanese and spanish.  earlier work with a colleague on using civilisation iii to teach students about history showed that it could be a powerful way to get them to realise that solving a society s problems can not always come from making a single change. a report on the experiment said:  students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play  using geography and history as tools for their game  and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play.  mr purushotma s ideas were aired in an article for the journal language learning and technology.,-1.2457137
877,tech,nintendo handheld given euro date nintendo s new handheld console  the ds  will launch in europe on 11 march  the company has announced.  the portable games machine  which features touch-screen control  will retail for £99 in the uk (149 euros). nintendo said 15 games would be available in the uk at launch  with prices ranging from £19 to £29. more than 2.8 million ds consoles have been sold since it first appeared in the us and japan at the end of 2004. rival sony has said it will launch its first handheld console  the psp  in the us and europe before the end of march. the psp is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market  despite sony s assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers.  the 15 games available on the european launch date will include nintendo s super mario 64 ds  as well as titles from third-party developers such as ubisoft s rayman ds.  more than 120 games are in development for the new console  nintendo has said. the ds is backwards compatible with the game boy advance  allowing the earlier machine s back catalogue of 700 games to be played. additionally  a short-range wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the ds  with a  download play  option which allows a group to play against each other  even if just one person owns a copy. other features include a short-range messaging application called pictochat  and a built-in microphone which is used in sega s launch title project rub. nintendo has also announced a media adapter  which will allow the console to play music and video on the move.  the launch price of £99 (149 euros) compares favourably with the us price of $149  according to john houlihan  editor of the computerandvideogames.com magazine.  it s a very  very competitive price point. there are some innovative features  and nintendo has created quite a buzz   he says.  however  the line-up of games could have been stronger. everyone wanted to see the eight-player mario kart ds  for example.   mr houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the nintendo ds and sony s new psp  with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device.  the psp is a sexy bit of kit  but sony s attitude to the psp has been very understated in europe  so far   mr houlihan said. the worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2.6bn at the end of 2004  according to industry analysts screen digest.  in the past  games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in europe than in other parts of the world. however nintendo president satoru iwata said the company was  pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the us and european launch .  europe is an extremely important market for nintendo   mr iwata added. nintendo raised its sales targets for the ds console last december after selling a million in the us and japan in just a few weeks.,-2.6210327
28,politics,terror suspects face house arrest uk citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary.  it comes after law lords ruled that the detention of 12 foreign terror suspects without trial breached human rights. charles clarke s planned  control orders  mean anyone suspected of being involved in terrorism could be subject to house arrest  curfews or tagging. the law society dubbed mr clarke s new proposals an  abuse of power . deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in belmarsh prison in london under the current laws introduced after the us terror attacks on 11 september 2001. mr clarke said efforts would continue to deport them to their countries of origin algeria  tunisia  egypt and jordan without them facing torture or death.  under the proposed changes - prompted by the house of lords ruling - the home secretary could order british citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported  to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet.  british citizens are being included in the changes after the law lords said the current powers were discriminatory because they could only be used on foreign suspects. mr clarke also said intelligence reports showed some british nationals were now playing a more significant role in terror threats. human rights lawyer clive stafford-smith said the plans were a  further abuse of human rights in britain .  mr clarke said prosecutions were the government s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in  serious  cases  with independent scrutiny from judges.  he told mps:  there remains a public emergency threatening the life of the nation.  he accepted the law lords  ruling but argued detention powers had helped prevent attacks and deter terrorists. the current detainees would not be freed until the new powers were in place as they were still considered a national security threat  he told mps.  there have been calls for the rules for wire-tap and intercept evidence to be allowed to be used in courts but mr clarke refused to back that change.  he said intercept evidence was only a small part of the case against the men and some of it could not be used because it could put sources  lives at risk. most of the terror suspects are being held indefinitely at belmarsh prison  in london. conservative shadow home secretary david davis was worried about extending special powers to cover british citizens. he warned:  throughout history  internment has generally backfired because of the resentment it creates.  so unless the process is clearly just  the home secretary could find himself confining one known terrorist only to recruit 10 unknown terrorists.  he suggested changing the law to let security-cleared judges view evidence gathered by phone-tapping could allow more terror cases to come to court.  liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten also backed use of wire-tap evidence. he said the standard of proof for the new powers would have to be  very high indeed  and he asked whether ministers had looked at measures which fitted with human rights laws. shami chakrabarti  from human rights group liberty  joined calls for intercept evidence to be allowed in trials. she said:  adherence to the rule of law should not be a game of cat and mouse. the government should not swap one human rights  opt out  for another.,0.34304667
1816,politics,blair and blunkett sheffield trip tony blair is to join home secretary david blunkett in a visit to sheffield on thursday.  mr blunkett s conduct is being looked at to establish whether he abused his position in relation to his ex-lover. the parliamentary standards watchdog is looking at his decision to give kimberly quinn free rail tickets. he is also being investigated over the visa application of mrs quinn s ex-nanny. the visit to sheffield will be seen as a show of unity by mr blair.  on wednesday during prime minister s questions  tory leader michael howard went on the offensive over comments mr blunkett is alleged to have made in a new biography. he is understood to have made a series of criticisms about his cabinet colleagues from the prime minister down. mr howard said mr blunkett had complained he had inherited a  giant mess  when he took over at the home office from jack straw  now foreign secretary. the tory leader went on:  he doesn t stop there: he thinks the culture secretary s weak; he thinks the trade secretary doesn t think strategically and he thinks the education secretary hasn t developed as expected.  he says the prime minister doesn t like being told the truth and the chancellor - no doubt the prime minister will agree with this - is a bully.  mr blair retorted voters remembered the record of a government and no comments by politicians.  the home secretary has already admitted he was wrong to give the two first class tickets  given to him as an mp  to mrs quinn and has since paid the £180 back. he has apologised for  a genuine mistake  and says he will write to the watchdog to answer further questions. the rail tickets are meant to help mps  spouses get between westminster and their constituencies. after his inquiry  parliamentary watchdog sir philip mawer will report to the commons standards and privileges committee  the group of mps who will recommend to the full house of commons what action - if any - should be taken against mr blunkett.  the separate inquiry by ex-senior civil servant sir alan budd is investigating whether the home secretary helped fast-track a bid by mrs quinn s nanny  leoncia casalme  to stay in the uk. last week  mr blunkett won the first round of a high court battle with mrs quinn for access to her son. mr blunkett declined to comment about his own position  saying the inquiry was under way and the high court had stressed his right to privacy did not affect his job in improving security and stability. downing street has stressed mr blair s support for the home secretary.,1.0493393

1667,tech,broadband in the uk gathers pace one person in the uk is joining the internet s fast lane every 10 seconds  according to bt.  the telecoms giant said the number of people on broadband via the telephone line had now surpassed four million. including those connected via cable  almost six million people have a fast  always-on connection. the boom has been fuelled by fierce competition and falling prices  as well as the greater availability of broadband over the phone line.  the take-up rate for broadband is accelerating at a terrific pace   said ben verwaayen  bt s chief executive.  we will be in a very strong position to hit our five million target by summer 2006 much earlier than we had previously expected.   the last million connections were made over the past four months  with thousands of people being added to the total every day of the week.  those signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from bt or via the many companies that re-sell bt lines under their own name. part of the surge in people signing up was due to bt stretching the reach of adsl - the uk s most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond six kilometres. asymmetric digital subscriber line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. the standard speed is 512kbps  though faster connections are available. according to bt  more than 95% of uk homes and businesses can receive broadband over the phone line. it aims to extend this figure to 99.4% by next summer. there are also an estimated 1.7 million cable broadband customers in the uk.,0.36834145
2168,business,mci shareholder sues to stop bid a shareholder in us phone firm mci has taken legal action to halt a $6.75bn (£3.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant verizon  hoping to get a better deal.  the lawsuit was filed on friday after qwest communications  which had an earlier offer for mci rejected  said it would submit an improved bid. mci s directors have backed verizon  despite it tabling less money. they are accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by depriving mci shareholders  of maximum value .  according the legal papers filed in a delaware court  verizon is set to pay an   unconscionable  unfair and grossly inadequate  sum for mci  which was formerly known as worldcom. qwest said on wednesday that mci had rejected a deal worth $8bn. a number of large mci shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision  saying that verizon s offer  made up of cash  shares and dividends  undervalued the company. friday s lawsuit argues that the verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the us phone industry will put a premium on mci s network  assets and clients. mci s directors have argued that verizon is bigger than qwest  has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. chief executive michael capellas spent last week meeting with shareholders in an effort to win their backing.  in 2002  investors in the then-named worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal. however  the firm - now renamed mci - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last april. it is a long-distance and corporate phone firm  and would provide the buyer with access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. mci shares jumped on friday  hitting their highest level since april 2004 amid speculation that it would be the focus of a bidding war. a takeover of mci would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. earlier this month  sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone pioneer at&t for about $16bn.,0.54491234

153,business,german business confidence slides german business confidence fell in february knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in europe s largest economy.  munich-based research institute ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in february from 97.5 in january  its first decline in three months. the study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.   we re surprised that the ifo index has taken such a knock   said dz bank economist bernd weidensteiner.  the main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak  particularly in the retail trade.  economy and labour minister wolfgang clement called the dip in february s ifo confidence figure  a very mild decline . he said that despite the retreat  the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected  a modest economic upswing  to continue.  germany s economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. however  the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004  mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and ifo president hans-werner sinn said any improvement in german domestic demand was sluggish. exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004  but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making german products less competitive overseas. on top of that  the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms  including daimlerchrysler  siemens and volkswagen  have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. analysts said that the ifo figures and germany s continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the european central bank. eurozone interest rates are at 2%  but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation  prompting fears that interest rates may rise.,1.6307795
1327,tech,have hackers recruited your pc  more than one million computers on the net have been hijacked to attack websites and pump out spam and viruses.  the huge number was revealed by security researchers who have spent months tracking more than 100 networks of remotely-controlled machines. the largest network of so-called zombie networks spied on by the team was made up of 50 000 hijacked home computers. data was gathered using machines that looked innocent but which logged everything hackers did to them.  the detailed look at zombie or  bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the honeynet project - a group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as  honey pots  to attract hackers and gather information about how they work. while  bot nets have been known about for some time  estimates of how widespread they are from security firms have varied widely.  to gather its information the german arm of the honeynet project created software tools to log what happened to the machines they put on the web. getting the machines hijacked was worryingly easy. the longest time a honeynet machine survived without being found by an automatic attack tool was only a few minutes. the shortest compromise time was only a few seconds. the research found that  once compromised machines tend to report in to chat channels on irc servers and wait instructions from the malicious hacker behind the tools used to recruit the machine. many well-known vulnerabilities in the windows operating system were exploited by  bot net controllers to find and take over target machines. especially coveted were home pcs sitting on broadband connections that are never turned off.  the months of surveillance revealed that the different  bot nets - which involve a few hundred to tens of thousands of machines - are used for a variety of purposes. many are used as relays for spam  to route unwanted adverts to pc users or as launch platforms for viruses. but the research team found that many are put to very different uses. during the monitoring period  the team saw  bot nets used to launch 226 distributed denial-of-service attacks on 99 separate targets. these attacks bombard websites with data in an attempt to overwhelm the target. using a  bot net of machines spread around different networks and nations makes such attacks hard to defend against. one ddos attack was used by one firm to knock its competitors offline. other  bot nets were used to abuse the google adsense program that rewards websites for displaying adverts from the search engine. some networks were used to abuse or manipulate online polls and games. criminals also seem to be starting to use  bot nets for mass identity theft  to host websites that look like those of banks so confidential information can be gathered and to peep into online traffic to steal sensitive data.  leveraging the power of several thousand bots  it is viable to take down almost any website or network instantly   said the researchers.  even in unskilled hands  it should be obvious that  bot nets are a loaded and powerful weapon.,1.3382065
1623,tech,global blogger action day called the global web blog community is being called into action to lend support to two imprisoned iranian bloggers.  the month-old committee to protect bloggers  is asking those with blogs to dedicate their sites on 22 february to the  free mojtaba and arash day . arash sigarchi and mojtaba saminejad are both in prison in iran. blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions. iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time.  i hope this day will focus people   curt hopkins  director of the committee  told the bbc news website.  the group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take  including writing to local iranian embassies. the committee has deemed tuesday  free mojtaba and arash day  as part of its first campaign. it is calling on the blogsphere - the name for the worldwide community of bloggers - to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of mojtaba and arash as well as other  cyber-dissidents .  if you have a blog  the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except  free mojtaba and arash day    said mr hopkins.  that would mean you could see that phrase 7.1 million times. that alone will shine some light on the situation.  if you don t have one  find one dedicated to that - it takes about 30 seconds.  technorati  a blog search engine  tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12 000 are added daily. a blog is created every 5.8 seconds  according to a us research think-tank.  the committee to protect bloggers was started by us blogger curt hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger ellen simonetti as a deputy director. she has since started the international bloggers  bill of rights  a global petition to protect bloggers at work. although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means  it aims to be the hub or organisation  information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech.  the committee  although only a month old  aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future  and will operate as a non-for-profit organisation.  blogging is in this weird no man s land. people think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view   said mr hopkins.  some think of themselves as pundits  kind of like journalists  and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform.  but they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold.   it is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers. the question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. high profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal  and often anonymous blogs  have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in.   this is a big messy argument   explained mr hopkins. he added:  it is just such a new way of doing business  there will be clamp downs.  but the way these issues get tested is through the courts which  said mr hopkins   is part of the whole messy conversation.   if you haven t already got bloggers in your company  you will have them tomorrow - and if you don t have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one. mr hopkins said that the blogsphere - which is doubling every five months - was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog.  everyone does this - mums  radicals  conservatives   he said. many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community.  that is the essential difference. what i call  templating software  gives every single person on earth the chance to have one.  you don t even have to have your own computer.,2.20256

1720,politics,mandelson warning to bbc the bbc should steer away from  demonising  ex-downing street media chief alastair campbell  peter mandelson has said.  the european commissioner and former labour minister was speaking amid claims that mr campbell is part of a labour  dirty tricks  campaign. that charge was denied by mr mandelson  who said the tories were afraid of mr campbell s campaigning skills. he warned the bbc that attacking mr campbell had brought it trouble before. that was a reference to the hutton inquiry following a bbc story claiming downing street  sexed up  iraq s weapons of mass destruction dossier.  the affair prompted the resignation of bbc chairman gavyn davies  director-general greg dyke and reporter andrew gilligan. labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about tory leader michael howard s past.  mr mandelson  a former labour communications director  told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  i understand why the tories will be gunning for alastair campbell because they fear his campaigning skills.  what i understand less is why the bbc should be joining with the tories in driving that agenda.  in my experience of these things  parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy.  i suggest the bbc concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics  the trivialisation of the campaign.  i think the bbc would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone  concentrate on the issues as i say  not resume their demonisation of alastair campbell - we all know where that led before.   mr campbell is acting as an adviser for labour  which denies engaging in personal campaigning. conservative co-chairman liam fox said mr campbell s return and labour poster plans attacking mr howard - recently withdrawn from the party s website - were a sign of  abusive politics .  the government  despite the fact that they would say want to go forward  not back  seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly  about the future   he said on sunday. labour peer baroness kennedy  who is chairing the power inquiry into political disengagement  said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks.  this feeling of distrust is going to be enlarged if this campaigning on all sides is conducted in the way that it looks as if it just might   she said.,2.5563593

1508,politics,kennedy s cautious optimism charles kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election.  in his 22 years in the commons  he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and  he might say  the uk s political and electoral system. but even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months  time.  look  i have already said i am not going to put any artificial limits on our ambitions this time around   he said. he still seems to accept that the most likely outcome is another labour victory of some sort. and his general election pitch is designed around the notion of the lib dems as the  real  opposition.  but doesn t that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second  he is prepared to go this far:  a clear conclusion has been reached  including by conservatives  that the conservatives are not going to win this election.  therefore the potential is there for the liberal democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election  given that we have the capacity to take on labour and win as well as take on the conservatives and win.  this is really going to be the first modern three party uk election that we have all experienced . but haven t we been here before  with suggestions in the 1980s that labour was finished. won t voters looking for an alternative to labour still naturally gravitate to the conservatives   the problem is that  geographically  the conservative party has melted away in about a third of britain.  we have supplanted them as the main alternative to labour in whole tracts of mainland britain. and they are a party with an ageing and declining membership base and they just do not look vibrant or vital or in touch any longer with contemporary britain .  mr kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned labour voters.  he insists his three headline commitments  to be financed from a 1% tax increase on those earning over £100 000 a year  will appeal right across the political spectrum. they are to replace the council tax with a local income tax  provide free long term care for the elderly and scrap student fees. he also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to old labour.  i think the tax argument has moved on a lot in british politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election   he said. under a labour government the tax burden would have to rise  while the tories  plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible  he claims.   we are being straightforward with people  saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden  we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies .   that is a clear cut choice for people  one i am very comfortable with and i think will distinguish us from the others . as to his own future  he is clear. if  as expected  his party increases its showing at the election  he intends to go into the next parliament  on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because i see that as the decisive opportunity for us . that last remark reflects a view gaining ground in westminster that  if the tories do as badly as some fear  the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party. perhaps then mr kennedy will be ready to put some of the caution to one side.,0.57691383
2129,business,strong dollar  call halts slide the us dollar s slide against the euro and yen has halted after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was  in america s interest .  but analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the us economy were still significant. they also pointed out that positive comments apart  president george w bush s administration had done little to stop the dollar s slide. a weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. the dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100gmt  still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 november. against the japanese yen  it was trading at 105.28 yen  after hitting a seven-month low of 105.17 earlier in the day.  policy makers in europe have called the dollar s slide  brutal  and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. however  it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro s rise at a monthly meeting of eurozone ministers late on monday. higher growth in europe is regarded by us officials as a way the huge us current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. mr snow who is currently in dublin at the start of a four-nation eu visit  has applauded ireland s introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth.  the eurozone is growing below its potential. when a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners   he said. mr snow s comments may have helped shore up the dollar on monday  but he was careful to qualify his statement.   our basic policy  of course  is to let open  competitive markets set the values   he explained.  markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals.  us officials have also said that other economies need to grow  so the us is not the main global growth engine. economists say that the fundamentals  or key indicators  of the us economy are looking far from rosy. domestic consumer demand is cooling  and heavy spending by president bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $427bn (£230bn). the current account deficit  meanwhile  hit a record $166bn in the second quarter of 2004. for many analysts  a weaker dollar is here to stay.  no end is in sight   said carsten fritsch  a strategist at commerzbank .  it is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $1.30.  some analysts maintain the us is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in europe  thus boosting its economy.,1.5414753

1400,tech,be careful how you code a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action  warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson.  if it gets its way  the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament  lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them. if the new law was about border controls  defence or even the new constitution  then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives. sadly for those who will be directly affected  the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs  a topic that may excite the bloggers  campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain. after all  how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions  and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention  yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu s ministerial councils  as seems likely  it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us. many observers of the computing scene  including myself  think the results will be disastrous for small companies  innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement. it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors  use of really obvious ideas.  in the us you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re-enter them unless amazon lets you  because they hold the patent on  one-click  online purchase. it is a small invention  but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it.  we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here  but perhaps not for long. the new proposals go back to 2002  although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s. they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made  endorsed by the council of ministers  radically modified by the european parliament and then re-presented in their original form. some national governments seem to be aware of the problems. poland has rejected the proposal and germany s main political parties have opposed it  but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection. early in december the british government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals. science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position  but according to those present  it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned.  the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an  a  item and can only be approved or rejected. no discussion or amendment is allowed. so why should we be worried  first  there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments. this goes to the heart of the european project  and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried. if coders are treated like this today  who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow   more directly  once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else s patent. this is not about stealing software  as code is already protected by copyright. patents are not copyright  but something much stronger. a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention  even if the other person invented it separately. i have never  to my shame  managed to read lord byron s childe harold s pilgrimage. if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence. the same does not hold for a patent. if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files  then i am in trouble under patent law  at least in the us. coincidence is no defence. the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies  but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents. they have legal departments and  more crucially  patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders.  even this system breaks down  of course  as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer (and other browsers) infringed an eolas patent. that one was eventually thrown out  but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars. but small companies  and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade. much of the really useful software we use every day  programs like the apache web server  the gnu/linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser  is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements. the damage to software will not happen overnight  of course. if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products. eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly  probably with some secret funding from one or two large players. the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas. and it will damage europe s computer industry. we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law.  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.,-0.8540807
1371,politics,concerns at school diploma plan final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for england s secondary schools put forward by the tomlinson report.  the government s response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week. some are worried it could be scuppered if  as tony blair and ruth kelly have suggested  gcses and a-levels stay. sir mike tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. he is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. but the government was said to be still rewriting its response on friday.  it will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response   said the chairman of the commons education select committee  labour mp barry sheerman.  his main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications.  we must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system   he wrote in the times educational supplement.  it is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak.  the qualifications and curriculum authority (qca) has also told the government not to  compromise . the qca said the potential  step-change in participation and attainment  lay in the integrity of the whole diploma.  any partial implementation of the proposals would  in our view  compromise that integrity   said its chairman  sir anthony greener. it is a sign of the qca s concern that its advice went to ministers last december but was publicised only recently. but people understand that a white paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the department for education and skills. they may be content if it does not  close too many doors  in writing - whatever spin is put on it.  the chief inspector of schools  david bell  also said recently that gcses and a-levels should go.  one of the reasons why i m so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it s good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system   he said.  if we don t say this is a sea-change in education  we will miss a great opportunity.  universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the tomlinson proposals  which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. a note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers  organisation  the cbi  which complains of a lack of skills. in an attempt to address this  the tomlinson plan is for tests in  functional  maths and literacy - decidedly not gcses. it has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms  concerns on this score. another dissenter is sir mike tomlinson s predecessor as chief schools inspector  professor chris woodhead  who has said there is no need for such a  massive upheaval . the conservative party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top a-level grade  no matter how well the others have done.,0.9122081

1084,business,gsk aims to stop aids profiteers one of the world s largest manufacturers of hiv/aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills - supplied to poorer african countries - back into europe for resale at far higher price.  the company  glaxosmithkline  is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills  currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement. it is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way. this is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies. they want to maintain their profits  but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti-aids drugs to the world s poorest nations.  the result is that drugs supplied to africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in europe; bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of hiv-positive africans through their government s health care systems.  but the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re-selling them at a higher price. glaxosmithkline believes that by coating the pills destined for africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging  then this trade can be substantially reduced. the company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in africa who have re-sold humanitarian drugs for profit  as well as those suppliers in europe that have also been involved in the trade. glaxo says distribution of the new-look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in europe.,-0.5463724
381,politics,e-university  disgraceful waste  a failed government scheme to offer uk university courses online has been branded a  disgraceful waste  by mps.  the e-university was scrapped last year  having attracted only 900 students at a cost of £50m. chief executive john beaumont was paid a bonus of £44 914  despite a failure to bring in private sector backers. the commons education select committee called this  morally indefensible  but the government said the e-university project had  improved understanding .  a department for education and skills spokeswoman said the venture had been  ambitious and ground-breaking  but take-up had not been  sufficient to continue with the project . she added:  uk e-universities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom.  the select committee found that those responsible for founding the e-university in 2000 had been caught up in the  general atmosphere of enthusiasm  surrounding the internet. initial business plans forecast a quarter of a million students joining within a decade  bringing in at least £110m in profit.  but virtually no market research was carried out and just £4.2m was spent on worldwide sales and marketing of courses. some £14m went on developing the technology to make the e-university work. this was used by just 200 students  the rest preferring to work through existing university websites. with no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister  the e-university had had  too much freedom to spend public money as it wished   the report found. committee chairman barry sheerman said:  uk e-university was a terrible waste of public money.  the senior executives failed to interest any private investors and showed an extraordinary over-confidence in their ability to attract students to the scheme.  the report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the e-university  but  should learn the lessons from this disaster .,1.0383272

1800,tech,microsoft makes anti-piracy move microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.  the windows genuine advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005. it will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates  but their options would be  limited . microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect pcs. either pcs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through microsoft s site. those running pirated windows programs would not have access to other downloads and  add-ons  that the software giant offers.  people who try to manually download security patches will have to let microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.  microsoft s regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms  viruses and other threats penetrating pcs. some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats  with more pcs left unprotected. but graham cluley  senior consultant at security firm sophos  told the bbc news website that it was a positive decision.  it sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of windows is good news for everyone who uses the net   he said. windows genuine advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in september 2004 for english-language versions of windows.  microsoft s windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. the company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. software piracy has cost the company billions  it says. the company announced earlier in january that it was releasing security tools to clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware  which 90% of pcs are infected with. the virus-fighting program  updated monthly  is a precursor to microsoft s dedicated anti-virus software. last year it introduced the windows xp counterfeit project  a uk-based pilot scheme  which ran from november to december. the scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november could replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones for free. it is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in china  norway and the czech republic  where pirated software is a huge problem  by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies windows.  china in particular is a problem  with piracy estimated at 92%   said mr cluley.,4.9060273

1516,politics,falconer rebuts  charade  claims concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia  through the back door  were not a political ploy  the lord chancellor has said.  ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the mental capacity bill amid chaotic scenes in the commons on tuesday. lord falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer. he said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some mps argue the situation is still unclear.  the bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves. ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards. critics fear it could allow  killing by omission  through withdrawing treatment  including food and fluids.  tony blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill. but changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from hillsborough coma victim tony bland.  it is important we don t end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen   he said.  on tuesday  the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203  despite rebellion by 34 labour mps. the revolt was also reduced by news that lord falconer had promised the catholic archbishop of cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill. but that only came after mps bombarded constitutional affairs minister david lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark. eventually  he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes  prompting claims of a shambles. the deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been.  lord falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the house of lords. he told bbc news:  we have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life.  the motive has got to be to end suffering.  he denied the concessions were a  political manoeuvre  forced by panic about the rebellion. it was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through parliament but the result was a  sensible solution   he said.  i don t think it is something to be embarrassed about. these issues are not easy to deal with   he went on. bbc political editor andrew marr said mr lammy was  waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast  after his performance. but lord falconer praised his minister for an  excellent job . former conservative leader iain duncan smith  one of the chief critics of the plans  condemned the debate as a  charade  and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague.,2.5452075

1639,business,feta cheese battle reaches court a row over whether only greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the european court of justice.  the danish and german governments are challenging a european commission ruling which said greece should have sole rights to use the name. the commission s decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to italian parma ham and french champagne. but critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term  with the cheese produced widely outside greece.  the commission s controversial 2002 ruling gave  protected designation of origin  status to feta cheese made in greece  effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there.  from 2007 onwards  greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in europe must find another name to describe their products. the german and danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years.  in our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese   hans arne kristiansen  a spokesman for the danish dairy board  told the bbc. denmark is europe s second largest producer of feta after greece - producing about 30 000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to greece. it is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in denmark such as brie.  it would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation   mr kristiansen said.  that is just one of the costs.   the case will also have a major impact on britain s sole feta producer  yorkshire company shepherds purse cheeses.  judy bell  the company s founder  said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product.  if we lose we will have to go through a massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation   she said.  we have never tried to pull the wool over anyone s eyes - it s very clear from the label that it s yorkshire feta.  the original decision was a victory for greece  where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6 000 years. feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat s milk  and is an essential ingredient in greek cuisine. greece makes 115 000 tonnes  mainly for domestic consumption. the court is expected to reach a verdict in the case in the autumn.,-2.44525
2108,politics,taxes must be trusted - kennedy public trust in taxes is breaking down because labour and tories are not being straight with people on the issue  lib dem leader charles kennedy has said.  a day ahead of the government s pre-budget report  mr kennedy used a speech to say his party was facing up to  painful economic realities . he said the current level of taxation was about right  although he would put a new 50% tax on top earners. other parties have accused the lib dems of making uncosted promises. mr kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation. the lib dems have already published what they say are the full costings for all their plans and wednesday s speech did not announce new policies.  speaking at the commonwealth club  mr kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility  both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver. he said.  budgets have to add up. tough choices are needed in public spending.  the lib dems would cut  low priority  spending  including the government s id cards scheme and the child trust fund.  those cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over-75s  putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks  he said. the lib dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax. now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new 50% tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees  providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down. there would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the  polluter who pays .  the lib dems say the tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while labour has hidden most of its tax rises. mr kennedy said:  that contract with the people - that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely - can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans.  with the stealth tax strategy of gordon brown  the obvious unfairness of our current tax system - especially the council tax  and the empty promises of the conservative party on this issue - it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down.  he challenged the treasury to open up its books so the national audit office can report on the government s performance.  conservative co-chairman liam fox said: liam fox said  if charles kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their 100 spending commitments.  the reality is  the lib dems lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy  and the only people who would face  tough choices  would be the families who would be £630 worse off a year.   and chancellor gordon brown said the lib dem figures did not add up. he accused the party of claiming it would spend less while across the country committing itself to spend more.,3.2515094
2143,tech,camera phones are  must-haves  four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year  says a report from analysts gartner.  globally  the number sold will reach 159 million  an increase of 104%. the report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly  must-have  buy. in europe  cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. but in japan and asia pacific  where camera phone technology is much more advanced  mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. japan still dominates mobile phone technology  and the uptake there is huge. by 2008  according to gartner  95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.  camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them  as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms (multimedia messaging services). this has changed in the last 18 months. handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways  they have introduced more design features  like rotating screens and viewfinders  removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.  mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. these have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites  or mobile blogs - moblogs. but the report suggests that until image quality increases more  people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. the gartner report suggests that by mid-2005  it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality  and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. but a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. some handsets already feature limited zoom capability  and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions  like nightclubs. other developments include wide-angle modes  basic editing features  and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.  images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. an exhibition next month in aid of the charity mencap  will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.  the exhibition  fonetography  will feature images taken by photographers david bailey  rankin and nan goldin  and artists sir peter blake  tracey emin and jack vettriano. but some uses for them have worried many organisations. intel  samsung  the uk s foreign office and lawrence livermore national laboratories in the us  have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. many schools  fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. italy s information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers  profits. according to recent figures  sony ericsson s profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to september featured integrated cameras  it said.,-0.14960909

1325,tech,ask jeeves joins web log market ask jeeves has bought the bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs.  the bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read  search and share all the blogs they are interested in. ask jeeves said it was not planning to change bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. how much ask jeeves paid for bloglines was not revealed.  bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. to do this it makes use of a technology known as really simple syndication (rss) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. the acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. google acquired pyra labs  makers of the blogger software  in 2003. in 2004 msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. jim lanzone  vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us  said it did not acquire bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. he said ask jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.   the universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers   he said. mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with ask s my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links.  search engines are about discovering information for the first time and rss is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites   he said. it would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that ask jeeves operates. there would be no instant sweeping changes to bloglines  said mr lanzone.  our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away   he said. though mr lanzone added that ask jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology.  being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right   said mr lanzone. rumours about the acquisition were broken by the napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from ask jeeves insiders.,4.219433

1702,business,call to overhaul uk state pension the uk pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by a leading retirement think-tank.  the pensions policy institute (ppi) said replacing the state pension with a  citizen s pension  would help tackle inequality and complexity. the change would see pensions being calculated on length of residency in the uk rather than national insurance (ni) contributions. reform could reduce poverty by aiding people with broken employment records.  the ppi added that once the state system was reformed the government should look at options to overhaul private and workplace pensions. the think tank s proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the pensions commission s initial report into uk retirement savings. according to the pensions commission s report 12 million working people are not saving enough for their retirement. as a result  living standards could fall for the next generation of uk pensioners. the report added that a combination of higher taxes  higher savings and/or a higher average retirement age was needed to solve the uk pension crisis.,-0.53356886
1381,tech,millions to miss out on the net by 2025  40% of the uk s population will still be without internet access at home  says a study.  around 23 million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information  predicts the report by telecoms giant bt. it compares to 27 million  or 50%  of the uk  who are not currently online. the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is  wishful thinking   the report concludes.  the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly  those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more  the report suggests. as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive  the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access  it predicts.  the gap between  have-nets  and  have-nots  has been much talked about  but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark  the report suggests.  internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it   said adrian hosford  director of corporate responsibility at bt. costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological.  there is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. they don t have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits   said mr hosford.  as now  the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families  the older generation and the disabled.  those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots  the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025  the report forecasts. organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem  said mr hosford. the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain. in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment  online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs  explained mr hosford. such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome  he said.  if we don t address this problem now  it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs  education opportunities will be limited and they ll simply not be able to keep up with society   he said. the alliance for digital inclusion  an independent body with members drawn from government  industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.,-0.36500454

1830,tech,tough rules for ringtone sellers firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks.  the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones.  in the last couple of years ringtones  wallpapers  screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers  said jeremy flynn  head of third party services at vodafone.   if you are not on the operator s portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it s a problem of how people discover your services   he said. to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them  for instance  several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for.  what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently   said mr flynn.  people did not know they were being offered a subscription service.   we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here   he added.  the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk s phone firms.  everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct   said andrew bud  regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox.   it s all about transparency   he said.  consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it.   the consumer has a right to be protected   he said. christian harris  partnership manager of mobile content firm zed  said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads.  the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that s done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out   he said. the new rules came in to force on 15 january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for  said mr flynn. also  said mr flynn  vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules.  we have quite draconian contracts with firms   he said.  we do not have to say why. we can just cut them off.  under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal  stop  command sent via text message. he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service.  the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality   said mr flynn.,4.09515
1433,tech,when technology gets personal in 2020  whipping out your mobile phone to make a call will be quaintly pass&#233;. by then phones will be printed directly on to wrists  or other parts of the body  says ian pearson  bt s resident futurologist.  it s all part of what s known as a  pervasive ambient world   where  chips are everywhere . mr pearson does not have a crystal ball. his job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now  to guide industries into the future. inanimate objects will start to interact with us: we will be surrounded - on streets  in homes  in appliances  on our bodies and possibly in our heads - by things that  think . forget local area networks - these will be body area networks. ideas about just how smart  small  or even invisible  technology will get are always floating around. images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology. but now a new vision is surfacing  where smart fabrics and textiles will be exploited to enhance functionality  form  or aesthetics. such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed.  so mp3 players - the mass gadget of the moment - will disappear and instead become integrated into one s clothing  says mr pearson.  so the gadgets that fill up your handbag  when we integrate those into fabric  we can actually get rid of all that stuff. you won t necessarily see the electronics.  wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up  while  video tattoos   or intelligent electronic contact lenses  might function as tv screens for those on the move. however  this future of highly personal devices  where technology is worn  or even fuses with the body itself  raises ethical questions. if technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing  jewellery  and skin  there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans  says baroness susan greenfield. at a recent conference for technology  engineering  academic and fashion industry experts  at the royal society in london  neuroscientist baroness greenfield cautioned we  can t just sleepwalk into the future .  yet this technology is already upon us. researchers have developed computers and sensors worn in clothing. mp3 jackets  based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves  have already appeared in shops.  these  smart fabrics  have come about through advances in nano- and micro-engineering - the ability to manipulate and exploit materials at micro or molecular scale. at the nanoscale  materials can be  tuned  to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster  lighter  stronger and more efficient devices and systems. the textile and clothing industry has been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways. many developments are appearing in real products in the fields of medicine  defence  healthcare  sports  and communications. professional swimming suits reduce drag by incorporating tiny structures similar to shark skin. nanoscale titanium dioxide (tio2) coatings give fabrics antibacterial and anti-odour properties. these have special properties which can be activated in contact with the air or uv light. such coatings have already been used to stop socks smelling for instance  to turn airline seats into super stain-resistant surfaces  and applied to windows so they clean themselves. dressings for wounds can now incorporate nanoparticles with biocidal properties and smart patches are being developed to deliver drugs through the skin. but baroness greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being. if our clothing  skin  and  personal body networks  do the talking and the monitoring  everywhere we go  we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy. mr pearson picks up the theme  pointing out there are a lot of issues humans have to iron out before we become  cyborgian . his main concern is  privacy .  we are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really don t want every passer-by to know.  so we have to make sure we build security in this. if you are wearing smart make-up  where electronics are controlling the appearance  you don t want people hacking in and writing messages on your forehead.  as technology infiltrates our biology  how will our brains function differently   we cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this   warns baroness greenfield. there have already been successful experiments to grow human nerve cells on circuit boards. this paves the way for brain implants to help paralysed people interface directly with computers. clearly  the organic  carbon of our bodies and silicon is increasingly merging. the cyborg - a very familiar part-human  part-inorganic science fiction and academic idea - is on its way.,-0.8376126

2114,entertainment,how the academy awards flourished the 77th annual academy awards are taking place on 27 february with the stars of the movie-making world once again holding their breath to discover who will be showered with the honours this year. but from humble beginnings  how did the modern day extravaganza become the behemoth it is today   how it all started the first academy awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel - just over the road from their modern day home.  just 250 guests attended with ticket prices at $5.  the first film to win was wings  which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award. for the first 10 years or so  the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm  but in 1940 the winners were published in the los angeles times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results. as a result the sealed envelope system was introduced  leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today. when and where the tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner.  the ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous grauman s chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event. other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium. they are now held at the kodak theatre  which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6 000 people. until 1954 they were held on a thursday  then swapped around from monday to wednesday before sunday night was settled on  although the month swapped from may to april to march and now its current month of february. the first televised ceremony was in 1953  with bob hope as the mc. who was oscar  there is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as oscar.  one popular story is that academy librarian margaret herrick said the statue looked like her uncle oscar. a journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article.  the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburn s first best actress win in 1934. the academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939. the trophy was designed by mgm art director cedric gibbons. since its inception 2 530 oscars have been handed out. in support of the war effort  the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii. after the war  winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing. fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000  52 were recovered nine days later. winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out. who sits in judgement  the academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines. douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards. there are now 5 700 members of the academy - with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers. some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the academy  receipt of an academy award nomination  achievement of unique distinction  earning of special merit  or making an outstanding contribution to film. the stars who left empty-handed while many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the academy  there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics.  among the overlooked films were hobson s choice  dirty harry  the 39 steps  the searchers and king kong. actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included al jolson in the jazz singer (1927)  humphrey bogart in casablanca (1944)  gene kelly in singing in the rain (1952) and henry fonda in 12 angry men (1957). alfred hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations. his enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968. the show always goes on not even war has halted the glittering hollywood event. there were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in iraq  but as it didn t stop during world war ii or the vietnam war.  documentary winner michael moore ensured nobody forgot about the iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the american invasion. the ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses. the ceremony has been postponed on three occasions. los angeles floods in 1938 saw it put back a week. the death of martin luther king saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on president ronald reagan. controversies and other gaffes three people have refused oscars  including actor george c scott who said the whole thing was  demeaning . writer dudley nichols refused his academy award in 1935 for his screenplay for the insider because the writers  guild was striking at the time. marlon brando turned down his best actor oscar for the godfather in 1973 in protest as hollywood s apparent discrimination against native american people. he sent along a woman called sacheen littlefeather to collect his award. she was later revealed to be native american actress maria cruz.  the following year robert opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked  flashing a peace sign as well as everything else. the tv network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity. opal was murdered in 1979. frank capra was the butt of one major gaffe in 1934 when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared  come on up and get it  frank  to which frank capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant frank lloyd had won for cavalcade.  capra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for it happened one night.,-5.0982676
1193,tech,gadget market  to grow in 2005  the explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005  delegates at the world s largest gadget show  in las vegas  have been told.  the number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by 11%  while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important.  everything is going digital   kirsten pfeifer from the consumer electronics association  told the bbc news website. the consumer electronics show (ces) featured the pick of 2005 s products.  consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like hdtvs [high-definition tvs]  digital radio  and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005.  all the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry.  despite showing diversity  some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much  wow factor  as in previous years.  the portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of ces  which was the  time and place shifting  of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere  at any time. at the start of last year s ces  the cea predicted there would be an average growth of 4% in 2004. that figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players  personal video recorders and digital cameras. it was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice  with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed. part of this has been the rise in spending power of the  generation x-ers  who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them. more than 57% of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers  according to cea research. hybrid devices  which combine a number of multimedia functions  were also in evidence on the show floor.  a lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it   said stephen baker  a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm npd group.  some of these functions cost next to nothing to add.   as well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable mp3 players to giant high-definition tvs  several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders  such as microsoft chief bill gates. despite several embarrassing technical glitches during mr gate s pre-show speech  he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the us market. he unveiled new ways of letting people take tv shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices. he disappointed some  however  by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the xbox games console. another disappointment was the lack of exposure sony s new portable games device  the psp  had at the show. sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in march for the us and europe. it went on sale in japan before christmas. there were only two psps embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details. a sony representative told the bbc news website this was because sony did not consider it to be part of their  consumer technology  offering.  elsewhere at the show  there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens  including samsung s 102-inch (2.6 metre) plasma - the largest in the world. industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in 2005  with new formats for dvds coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional dvds. with so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage  like seagate s 5gb pocket sized external hard drive  which won an innovation for engineering and design prize. more than 120 000 trade professionals attended ces in las vegas  which officially ran from 6 to 9 january.,-0.1788187

1894,tech,eu software patent law faces axe the european parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.  politicians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. during consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. the bill was backed by some hi-tech firms  saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.  hugo lueders  european director for public policy at comptia  an umbrella organization for technology companies  said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would european inventors prosper. he said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the american system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. but opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation  be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. the proposed law had a troubled passage through the european parliament. its progress was delayed twice when polish meps rejected plans to adopt it. also earlier this month the influential european legal affairs committee (juri) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of meps. to become law both the european parliament and a qualified majority of eu states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. the latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the eu for re-consideration.,1.3360865
269,politics,tories reject rethink on axed mp sacked mp howard flight s local conservative association has insisted he will not be its candidate at the general election.  russell tanguay  agent for arundel and south downs tories  said mr flight was ineligible to be a candidate and the association was seeking a substitute. the news comes despite mr flight s allies saying they had enough support to hold a meeting to discuss his fate. mr flight landed in trouble over remarks on tory tax and spending plans. he quit as tory deputy chairman after apparently suggesting the tories planned extra spending cuts - but he wants to continue as an mp.  tory headquarters says he cannot stand as a conservative candidate because he is no longer an approved candidate. mr tanguay backed that view on tuesday  saying:  howard flight is ineligible to stand as a conservative party candidate.  the association is in the process of selecting a new candidate.   but the local tory chairman made similar comments on friday and dissent continues. two local councillors who back mr flight met mr tanguay and the local association s chairman in arundel on tuesday afternoon but did not comment as they left the meeting. mr flight says he will not stand down as a candidate unless his local party instructs him to do so at an extraordinary general meeting (egm). the mp  who is consulting his lawyers  told bbc news:  they selected me and they  if you like  dispose of me or keep me.  mr flight s supporters also say they have the 50 signatures needed to trigger the egm.  at a news conference  mr howard insisted he had played by the party s rules. the tory leader  who argues he is ensuring honesty  said:  we do not say one thing in private and another thing in public.   labour election campaign coordinator alan milburn said the tories were in  turmoil  because mr flight had exposed their hidden plans. the comments were not a  one-off   he said  claiming mr howard and other senior tories were obsessively committed to cutting public spending. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said:  whilst i disagree with howard flight s views  it seems extraordinary to sack somebody for telling the truth.   it has also emerged mr howard has suspended slough s constituency conservative association for refusing to deselect its candidate. adrian hilton was abandoned after suggesting the signing of the maastricht treaty  under john major s government  was an act of treason. the catholic herald also highlighted articles he wrote about the role of catholicism in the european union. mr hilton was chosen to fight the seat after the previous candidate  robert oulds  was sacked for being pictured with a range of guns and a hunting knife. slough conservative association has now been placed on  support status  and is being run from conservative campaign headquarters  says a senior party spokesman.  mr hilton on tuesday said he was considering taking legal action against his deposal. he said the local party had only learned of the final decision on the bbc news website on monday evening.  there are people at central office who are behaving like little dictators and seemingly people who are ordinary members are being treated with contempt   he said. the party says it did try to contact the local conservative chairman.,0.8188038

268,business,ex-boeing director gets jail term an ex-chief financial officer at boeing has received a four-month jail sentence and a fine of $250 000 (£131 961) for illegally hiring a top air force aide.  michael sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting darleen druyun while she still handled military contracts. ms druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring boeing when awarding lucrative contracts. boeing lost a $23bn government contract after a pentagon inquiry into the case. the contract  to provide refuelling tankers for the us air force  was cancelled last year.  the pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth $3bn which it believes may have been tainted by ms druyun s role in the procurement process. boeing sacked mr sears and ms druyun in november 2003 after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy. ms druyun had talks with mr sears in october 2002 about working for boeing  while she was still a top procurement official within the pentagon. she subsequently joined the company in january 2003. ms druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to boeing and other favoured companies.  in documents filed in a virginia court ahead of mr sears  sentencing  prosecutors blamed boeing s senior management for failing to ask key questions about the  legal and ethical issues  surrounding ms druyun s appointment. mr sears told prosecutors that no other boeing officials were aware that ms druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with boeing. however  analysts believe boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal. the pentagon has investigated 400 contracts  dating back to 1993  since the allegations against ms druyun came to light.  boeing s corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years. boeing was sued by lockheed martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition. boeing apologised publicly for the affair - although it claimed it did not gain any unfair advantage - and pledged to improve its procedures. the pentagon subsequently revoked $1bn worth of contracts assigned to boeing and prohibited the seattle-based company from future rocket work.,-1.4045963
1392,business,wall street cheers bush victory the us stock market has closed higher in response to george w bush s victory in the presidential elections.  the benchmark dow jones share index closed more than 1% higher at 10 137  while the nasdaq rose 0.9% to 2 004. many investors believe that mr bush s policies are more business-friendly than those of his democrat challenger  john kerry. the higher share prices also reflect relief that a clear winner has emerged from what proved to be a tight poll.  investors had worried that the outcome of the poll would be inconclusive  paving the way for a repeat of the legal wrangling that marred the 2000 election.  the dow lost 5% of its value in the three weeks immediately after that election  when it was unclear who would occupy the white house. mr kerry conceded defeat on wednesday  abandoning last-ditch hopes of carrying the vote in the swing state of ohio.  the relief for the markets may be that we have a decision and can move forward   said tim ghriskey  chief investment officer of solaris asset management. some analysts predicted that the jump in share prices would be short-lived  saying investors would quickly focus once again on the health of the us economy.  i would look at the stock market rally for bush as kind of a one-day event   said ken mayland at clearview economics. the us  recent economic performance has been mixed  with solid growth offset by disappointingly low job creation figures  and mounting worries over a record budget deficit. elsewhere in the financial markets on wednesday  the dollar dipped slightly against the euro and climbed against the yen  while us oil prices closed up $1.26 at $50.88 a barrel in new york. the rise in oil prices partly reflects the view that president bush is less likely than mr kerry to release supplies from the us  strategic oil reserve. share prices in london  frankfurt and paris also closed higher.  successive polls in the run-up to tuesday s election had shown the two candidates running neck and neck.  economic issues  as well as the war in iraq  were the forefront of the campaign. in key swing states such as ohio  which has suffered substantial job losses in the past four years  president bush s handling of the economy became a crucial election issue. senator kerry attacked president bush s economic record during his campaign  hammering home the fact that a net 800 000 jobs were lost during his term in office. president bush focused on the fact that two million jobs have been created in the past year  claiming that it has vindicated his tax-cutting agenda. as for future policies  both candidates pledged to bring america s $422bn federal budget deficit under control. senator kerry planned to increase taxes on those earning more than $200 000 a year. president bush has placed reform of the pensions system at the heart of his economic agenda for a second term. however  economists have said both candidates  economic programmes rested on questionable assumptions about future growth.,-1.3173852

355,business,eu  too slow  on economic reforms most eu countries have failed to put in place policies aimed at making europe the world s most competitive economy by the end of the decade  a report says.  the study  undertaken by the european commission  sought to assess how far the eu has moved towards meeting its economic targets. in 2000  eu leaders at a summit in lisbon pledged the european economy would outstrip that of the us by 2010. their economic targets became known as the lisbon agenda. but the commission report says that  in most eu countries  the pace of economic reform has been too slow  and fulfilling the lisbon ambitions will be difficult - if not impossible.  only the uk  finland  belgium  denmark  ireland and the netherlands have actually followed up policy recommendations. among the biggest laggards  according to the report  are greece and italy. the lisbon agenda set out to increase the number of people employed in europe by encouraging more older people and women to stay in the workforce. it also set out to raise the amount the private sector spends on research and development  while bringing about greater discipline over public spending and debt levels. combined with high environmental standards and efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the eu  the plan was for europe to become the world s most dynamic economy by 2010. next week  the commission will present revised proposals to meet the lisbon goals. many people expect the 2010 target to be quietly dropped.,1.8283482
646,tech,gritty return for prince of persia still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year s sands of time  the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within  and in a more bellicose mood than last time.  this sequel gives the franchise a grim  gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence. as before  you control the super-athletic prince from a third-person perspective. the time-travelling plot hinges on the dahaka  an all-consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages. the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beast s creation.  studiously structured though this back story is  everything boils down to old-fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves  on the whole  as dependable as it needs to be. ever since the series  then-groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga  prince of persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves  that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies  body parts.  those flashy moves are back in full evidence  and tremendous fun to perform and perfect. combining them at speed is the best fun  although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill. until you reach that point  it is a haphazard business. all too often  you will perform a stunning triple somersault  pirouette off a wall  knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop  before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom. that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance  for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path. the expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct  but combat is what is really been stepped up  and there is more of it than before. the game s developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways. slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off.  warrior within is a very slick package; the game s intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences.  it is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of onimusha 3 earlier this year  and when the game begins  it is something of an anti-climax. that said  the graphics are excellent  and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game. the music is probably the worst aspect - a merit-free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off. there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game. perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be. somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts  and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable. but that is not to say warrior within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy. it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for.,-2.371725

2032,tech,search sites get closer to users search sites want to get to know you better.  not content with providing access to the millions of websites  many now offer ways that do a better job of remembering  cataloguing and managing all the information you come across. some of the latest to update their search systems are ask jeeves and blinkx  which have both released a series of utilities that try to help people get more from the web.  the future is all about developing your own personal web   said tony macklin  spokesman for ask jeeves.  mr macklin said that too often when people use a search engine it was like the first time they ever used it  because there was no memory of what they had searched for before.  each time you go back in you have to start all over again   he said. the series of updates to its service  collected under the my ask jeeves banner  would help people remember where they had been before.  ask jeeves has added the ability to  save  websites of interest so the next time a users visits the site they can search through the sites they have previously found. sites saved in this way can be arranged in folders and have notes attached to them to explain why they were saved. mr macklin said many people wanted to save sites they had seen but did not want to add them to their bookmarks or favourites not least because such lists cannot be easily searched. on average  said mr macklin  users conduct between five and 10 searches per day and the tools in my ask jeeves should stop them having to do searches twice and get to what they want much more easily. under my ask jeeves users can search the web or through the results they have already noted as interesting.  it s about finding again what you found before   he said. the my ask jeeves service lets people store up to a 1000 web links or 5000 if they sign up to the free service. by way of comparison google s desktop search tool catalogues search histories informally and lets people look through the sites they have visited.  at the same time  search start-up blinkx has released a second version of its eponymous software. blinkx is desktop search software that watches what someone is working on  be it a document or e-mail  and suggests websites  video clips  blogs or documents on a pc that are relevant to it.  since blinkx launched it has faced increased competition from firms such as google  copernic  enfish  x1 and apple all of whom now have programs that let people search their pc as well as the web.  the competition has validated the problem we tackle   said suranga chandratillake  co-founder of blinkx. in the latest release of blinkx  the company has added what it calls smart folders. once created the folders act as persistent queries that automatically sweep the web for pages related to their subject and catalogues relevant information  documents or incoming e-mails  on hard drives too. what users do with blinkx and other desktop search engines shows that people tend to be very promiscuous in their use of search engines.  blinkx users do not stop using other web search systems   he said.  they might use google to look up a company  or yahoo for travel because they know they are good at that   he said.  the classic thing we have seen recently  is people using blinkx to look at the things they have searched on   he said. the variety of ways to search data was only helping users  said mr chandratillake and that it was likely that in the future people would use different ones for different tasks.,-0.7751503

1175,entertainment,director nair s vanity project indian film director mira nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make william makepeace thackeray s novel vanity fair - as the book has been a favourite through her life.  the book is one of the classics of english literature - the story of scheming 19th century social climber becky sharp  played in the film by reese witherspoon. nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film  which she has - controversially - made in a bollywood style  including two song-and-dance routines in the film s second half.  it was serendipity really - i was offered vanity fair by the studio focus features  who had distributed monsoon wedding   nair told bbc world service s masterpiece programme.  they offered me their next-best thing  not realising that vanity fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since i was 16 years old in an irish catholic boarding school in india.   since her 1988 debut feature salaam bombay! - nominated for the best foreign language oscar and winner of best first feature at cannes - nair has become one of india s most famous and respected directors. she is not restricted to bollywood  however - she followed salaam bombay! with mississippi masala  starring denzel washington  and the perez family  her first hollywood film.  her career peaked with monsoon wedding in 2001  which won the golden lion award at venice. nair s indian-style adaptation of vanity fair  however  has been attacked by critics in the us - where it only reached number eight at the box office in its opening week - who described the bollywood elements as  jarring.  the film has a new ending  with becky sharp running off for a new life in india. but nair said that her film had picked up on the way thackeray - who was born in india but moved to england as a young man - had seen the world.  first  when i was 16  it was becky sharp  who is a completely memorable character  because i recognised myself in her - i recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies  who wanted to buck the system that they were in   she said.  but it was the sort of novel i somehow kept at the side of my bed for many years  and i would dip into every now and then and suddenly get completely mesmerised again.  as i got older and read it  i think it was thackeray s clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society  the fact that he was born in india but came to england as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider  and yet he was an insider.  that perspective was something i really loved.   nair also defended her decision to cast an american actress - reese witherspoon - as becky sharp  despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are british or irish.  i cast intuitively - in my films i cast as many non-actors as i cast actors   she said.  for me  it is intuition - i have to fall in love with an actor. it is a visceral response.   thackeray describes becky sharp as a minx. also she s described as someone who s tiny  red-headed and thin. reese had that completely minx-like irresistibility about her.  having won the role because she seemed physically perfectly suited to the part  however  witherspoon then became pregnant. but nair said that  though this had created the need for some filming tricks  it had in fact also helped the film.  it was a self-fulfilling prophesy - when i first met her husband [actor ryan philippe]  i said  knock her up  won t you  i need some flesh on the girl    she joked.  i m not a fan of the underfed los angeles actor at all. this was  for me  about becky sharp being  eventually  a full-blown woman through the course of the film.  i love the luminosity that pregnancy brings  i love the fleshiness  i love the ample bosom - it gave me much more to play with.  nair explained how camera tricks had been used to disguise witherspoon s  bump  in various scenes - including hiring a number of young boys in costumes to stand in front of her.  she runs  she gets off coal carts  she jumps off horses - she does everything   nair said.  but there s also a certain carriage with horses that is going to wipe the screen at a certain moment  because of the bump.,-0.46011257

1471,business,glazer makes new man utd approach malcolm glazer has made a fresh approach to buy manchester united  which could lead to a bid valuing the premiership club at £800m.  the us tycoon  who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months  has approached the united board with  detailed proposals   it has confirmed. mr glazer  who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team  hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. his new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt. mr glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the red devils and responded by using his 28.1% shareholding to vote off three board members last november.  man united had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing. but newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debt-laden bid. last week  however  mr glazer issued a statement to the stock exchange distancing himself from a new bid.  meanwhile  united s chief executive david gill said in december that talks would not resume unless glazer came up with  definitive proposals . now the board has confirmed that the us bidder is back  with a statement issued on sunday reading:  the board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer.  a further announcement will be made in due course.   to succeed malcolm glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus  who own 28.9% of the club. but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach. united fans have reacted with anger at the announcement. they have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by glazer since he first showed interest in the club in september 2003 and after sunday s announcement they vowed to fight on.  we will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says. we do not want him or anybody else taking over united   said mark longden of the independent manchester united supporters  association.  the campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since glazer first showed interest in the club.,0.2585516
670,tech,dvd copy protection strengthened dvds will be harder to copy thanks to new anti-piracy measures devised by copy protection firm macrovision.  the pirated dvd market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago. macrovision says its new ripguard technology will thwart most  but not all  of the current dvd ripping (copying) programs used to pirate dvds.  ripguard is designed to... reduce dvd ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer   said the firm. macrovision said the new technology will work in  nearly all  current dvd players when applied to the discs  but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with ripguard. the new technology will be welcomed by hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from dvd sales.  the film industry has stepped up efforts to fight dvd piracy in the last 12 months  taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of dvd movies for download.   ultimately  we see ripguard dvd... evolving beyond anti-piracy  and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions  interoperability in tomorrow s digital home  and the upcoming high-definition formats   said steve weinstein  executive vice president and general manager of macrovision s entertainment technologies group. macrovision said ripguard was designed to plug the  digital hole  that was created by so-called decss ripper software. it circumvents content scrambling system measures placed on dvds and let people make perfect digital copies of copyrighted dvds in minutes. those copies could then be burned onto a blank dvd or uploaded for exchange to a peer-to-peer network. macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against  rent  rip and return  - where people would rent a dvd  copy it and then return the original. ripguard is expected to be rolled out on dvds from the middle of 2005  the company said. the new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used  those programs will now most likely crash  the company said. macrovision has said that rip guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures.,0.12064743

891,politics,councils  must find gypsy sites  ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers  amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments.  councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land. more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks  said housing minister yvette cooper. in november  mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3 500 travellers have no place to stop. ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places. that scheme has paid out £25m in four years  with £8m available for 2005.   there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites   said ms cooper.  firstly  local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites. and secondly  they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites.  the result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites  causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the gypsies and travellers.  that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites  as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short-term because of risk to local amenity and the environment.  under the new regulations  expected to be in force in the spring  officials will be able to serve  temporary stop notices  aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban. many mps with rural constituencies  particularly in eastern england  have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers  saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments.  andrew ryder  of the traveller law reform coalition  said:  we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers  so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored.  new accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers  as they often do.  living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals  legal action and eviction is no one s idea of fun.  in their november report  mps from the committee scrutinising the office for the deputy prime minister  responsible for housing  said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop. numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities  said the mps. in turn  the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents. two of the most controversial traveller sites - cottenham in cambridgeshire and minety in wiltshire - remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle.,0.747468

203,tech,how to make a gigapixel picture the largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the netherlands.  the finished image is 2.5 billion pixels in size - making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras. the huge image of delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the dutch city taken at a fixed spot. if printed out in standard 300 dots per inch resolution  the picture would be 2.5m high and 6m long.  the researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures. tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail. the website is already proving popular and currently has more than 200 000 visitors every day.  the image was created by imaging experts from the dutch research and technology laboratory tno which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge.  the goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images. the first image of such a size was manually constructed by us photographer max lyons in november 2003. that image portrayed bryce canyon national park  in utah  and was made up of 196 separate photographs. the panorama of delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in mr lyons  image.  he did it all by hand  which was an enormous effort  and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques  it would be feasible to build a larger image   said jurgen den hartog  one of the tno researchers behind the project.  we were not competing with mr lyons  but it started as a lunchtime bet.   the dutch team used already available technologies  although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high-resolution image.   we had to rewrite almost all the tools   me den hartog told the bbc news website.  all standard windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image  so we had to develop one ourselves.  the 600 component pictures were taken on july 2004 by a computer-controlled camera with a 400 mm lens. each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite. the stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful pcs over three days. following the success of this project  and with promises of help from others  the tno team is considering creating a full 360-degree panoramic view of another dutch city  with even higher resolution.,-0.9748349
2013,business,trade gap narrows as exports rise the uk s trade gap narrowed in november  helped by a 7.5% rise in exports outside the european union.  according to the office for national statistics  the difference between what the uk exported and imported was £3.1bn ($5.8bn)  down from october s £3.6bn. overall uk exports - including both goods and services - rose by more than 3.2% to £24.8bn  although total imports rose again to a new record of £27.9bn. the deficit for goods alone was £4.6bn  down from october s £5bn. during november the uk exported £16.9bn worth of goods  but imported £21.5bn. the cumulative deficit for the first eleven months of 2004 now stands at £36.3bn  £4.5bn higher than the same period in 2003.  november saw an improvement in export levels to both the european union and the rest of the world  the office for national statistics (ons) said. eu exports rose 2%  fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals. non-eu exports shot up 7.5%  with growth seen across a range of manufacturing sectors including cars  consumer durables and chemicals. the export boost offset a 1% rise in imports. non-eu imports rose 3%  but the growth in goods entering the uk from the eu slowed to 0.5%.  the uk s deficit with the eu fell to £1.9bn from £2.1bn  while its non-eu shortfall dropped to £2.7bn from £2.9bn in october.  the country s surplus on trade-in-services remained steady at £1.5bn for the fifth month in a row. paul dales  uk economist for capital economics  said the figures represented an improvement on recent months. however  he stressed that the long-term prognosis for exports was still uncertain.  the figures are a lot better than expected but the trend still remains poor   he said.  there have been some very encouraging signs that the uk export recovery is starting to take hold. but there is a danger that this could be held back by the ongoing weakness of domestic demand on the continent.,-1.5669937

476,politics,new foot and mouth action urged a senior tory mp has criticised agriculture department defra s  lackadaisical  approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak.  public accounts committee chairman edward leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. the national audit office said defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. but mr leigh said the department was  dragging its heels .  that comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. he also said defra had been  dreadfully slow  in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis.  the outbreak  which began in 2001  led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals  devastated many farms and rural businesses  and is estimated to have cost the uk up to £8bn.  four years after the outbreak  defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors  costs  and £40m of invoices remain unpaid   mr leigh said. mr leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an it system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. in november it emerged european commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the uk government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis.  ministers had hoped to get £900m from the european union vet fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. that was because the uk had valued the culled animals at between  two and three times  the commission s assessment of their likely market value. national audit office chief sir john bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. on the issue of the unpaid invoices  sir john said defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001   but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations .  mr leigh said being  better prepared  would also help avoid the need for  mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak . a defra spokesman said:  we welcome the report. it acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak.  however  the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.,0.8164749
1291,sport,man utd stroll to cup win wayne rooney made a winning return to everton as manchester united cruised into the fa cup quarter-finals.  rooney received a hostile reception  but goals in each half from quinton fortune and cristiano ronaldo silenced the jeers at goodison park. fortune headed home after 23 minutes before ronaldo scored when nigel martyn parried paul scholes  free-kick. marcus bent missed everton s best chance when roy carroll  who was later struck by a missile  saved at his feet.  rooney s return was always going to be a potential flashpoint  and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. and rooney s every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. everton started brightly and fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from bent near the goal-line. but that was the cue for united to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a goodison park pitch that was cutting up. fortune gave united the lead after 23 minutes  rising to meet ronaldo s cross from eight yards after the portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless gary naysmith. united dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances  and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. mikel arteta played a superb ball into the area but bent  played onside by gabriel heintze  hesitated and carroll plunged at his fee to save. united almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when ronaldo s low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off tony hibbert  but martyn dived to save brilliantly. and martyn came to everton s rescue three minutes later when rooney s big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through  but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. but there was nothing martyn could do when united doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. scholes  free-kick took a deflection  and martyn could only parry the ball out for ronaldo  who reacted first to score easily. everton s problems worsened when james mcfadden limped off with an injury. and there may be further trouble ahead for everton after goalkeeper carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. rooney s desperate search for a goal on his return to everton was halted again by martyn in injury-time when he outpaced stubbs  but once again martyn denied the england striker.  - manchester united coach sir alex ferguson:  it was a fantastic performance by us. in fairness i think everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out.  the boy ronaldo is a fantastic player. he s persistent and never gives in.  i don t know how many fouls he had he gets up and wants the ball again  he s truly a fabulous player.  everton: martyn  hibbert  yobo  stubbs  naysmith  osman  carsley  arteta  kilbane  mcfadden  bent. subs: wright  pistone  weir  plessis  vaughan. manchester united: carroll  gary neville  brown  ferdinand  heinze  ronaldo  phil neville  keane  scholes  fortune  rooney. subs: howard  giggs  smith  miller  spector. referee: r styles (hampshire),0.75965786

1500,tech,smartphones suffer skulls attack owners of some nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper.  those downloading the software could find all the icons on their 7610 phone swapped for images of skulls. when installed the malicious program also locks many of the 7610 s functions making it hard to use and harder to repair. the program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones.  the file  nicknamed skulls  is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add-ons  such as wallpaper  games and ringtones  for their phones symbian said that it was not sure if the damage skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming. soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it. the program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the 7610 phone. the skulls program is labelled as a file called: 7610.extended.theme.manager.zip.  once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications  such as contacts  calendar  notebook etc with non-working versions so the phone becomes almost useless. the only thing the phone can do is make and take calls. a statement by symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it  one of which includes ignoring a security warning. symbian said that the spread of the skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself. despite this finnish anti-virus lab f-secure said it had sporadic reports of 7610 owners being caught out by it. the firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again. the skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias tee-222. symbian phones produced by sony ericsson  motorola  benq  arima and fujitsu are unaffected by the skulls program.,2.7996929

352,politics,councils prepare to set tax rises council tax in scotland is set to rise by an average of about 4% in the coming year  bbc scotland has learned.  authorities will decide final figures on thursday when projected increases will be more than twice the rate of inflation  which is currently 1.6%. the finance minister has urged councils to limit increases but they have warned that they will struggle to maintain services unless funding is increased. they say much additional government money is for new initiatives. scottish finance minister  tom mccabe msp  said:  last week in parliament i announced an additional £419m for core expenditure to local government in scotland.  that s a 5.5% increase and sits against an inflation rate of 1.6%  so i think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint.  mr mccabe is also looking for local authorities to become more efficient and save money in coming years. he told bbc radio scotland s sunday live programme:  here in scotland we have 32 councils who all have their own individual collection systems for council tax  they have their own payroll systems and their own human resource systems.   we think there has to be opportunities there for rationalisation and using the money saved to reinvest in frontline services.  the councils  umbrella organisation cosla  which provided bbc scotland with the indicative figures for next year  warned that councils would face a continuous struggle to maintain services. mr mccabe has promised them about £8.1bn next year.  however  most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services   a cosla spokesman said. cosla says that it is willing to work with the executive on finding efficiency savings but that these will not be enough to maintain services. they say the funding plans for the next three years will see councils lose more of the share of public spending. the conservatives accuse the scottish executive of using the council tax to raise funds because it is too afraid to raise income tax.  the tory finance spokesman  brian monteith msp  said:  its a form of disguise... yet again we see that council tax is being used as a way of passing on costs.  scared of actually using its three pence income tax that it could put up  what we ve seen over the years is more and more burdens being put onto local authorities and the council tax payer having to pick up the bill.  there are also warnings that unless funding to councils is increased in the next few years then services may have to be reduced. linda knox  director of the scottish local authority management centre at strathclyde university  said:  with this current settlement the increase is slowing. at the same time  the burdens on councils are greater than they were.  the settlement figures don t include pay increases and the executive is also requiring a substantial figure - in the area of £325m - in efficiency savings across the settlement period.  education will be protected from any cuts but linda knox says this will mean other services will suffer. she said:  in practice  that will mean a 4-5% cut for other services. on the face of it the settlement looks like an increase of about 9.7% but by the time you take into account other factors its probably only about 1% in real terms.,1.7701955

1522,business,fed chief warning on us deficit federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has warned that allowing huge us budget deficits to continue could have  severe  consequences.  speaking to the house budget committee he urged congress to take action to cut the deficit  such as increasing taxes. while the us economy is growing at a  reasonably good pace  he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the us. pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy  he said.  the government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby-boom generation retires.  i fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver. if existing promises need to be changed  those changes should be made sooner rather than later   mr greenspan said. he also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity  retirement and health programmes would need  significant  changes. he called on congress to cut promised benefits for retirees  as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford.  meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending  he added. he also urged congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the us heading further into the red. despite the dire warnings  mr greenspan did offer some good news for the short term. as us growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit. recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely  which should cut some costs. since president george w bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of $412bn last year.,-3.7839184

1006,business,winemaker rejects foster s offer australian winemaker southcorp has rejected a takeover offer worth 3.1bn australian dollars ($2.3bn; £1.8bn) from brewing giant foster s group.  southcorp  whose brands include penfolds  rosemount and lindemans  dismissed the offer as inadequate. the two companies held four days of talks after foster s bought an 18.8% stake in southcorp on 13 january. a merger would create a global player with worldwide annual sales of 39m cases and revenues of a$2.6bn.  southcorp said foster s a$4.17-a-share takeover proposal offered a  excellent strategic fit  but undervalued the company.  southcorp s board has informed foster s that it is not prepared to recommend the offer as it does not adequately reflect the strategic value of the company   said southcorp chairman brian finn.  southcorp said foster s takeover offer was  opportunistic . however  it said that the offer may represent an  opening bid   opening up the possibility of foster s returning with an improved offer.  foster s said a combination of the two companies would create a global player with an  unrivalled  collection of premium wine brands. despite being best known for brewing foster s lager  foster s is already one of australia s largest wine producers  owning the beringer and wolf blass brands among others.  the combination of foster s and southcorp will transform the global wine industry and significantly enhance australia s competitive position on the global stage   said trevor o hoy  foster s chief executive officer. foster s spent a$584m on buying an 18.8% stake in southcorp from the oatley family  which founded the rosemount estates business and later merged it into southcorp. shares in both companies were suspended while the two held talks about a deal. southcorp s shares rose 12% to a$4.76 on news of the offer but foster s shares fell 3.7% to a$5.44.,0.01006937

530,politics,labour s core support takes stock tony blair has told labour supporters he s  back  and still hungry for the job of prime minister - but does that sum up the mood at the party s spring conference in gateshead    the electorate are keener on the government than some labour party members   is the dry assessment of graham lane  leader of the labour group on newham council. the problem  according to mr lane  is not continuing divisions over iraq  foundation hospitals or tuition fees  or even voter apathy  but mr blair himself.  i have a new slogan. vote blair  get brown. that s what i am telling people on the doorstep. don t worry  he will be gone soon.  his friend  saxon spence  leader of devon county labour group  lays the blame for any lack of campaigning zeal on one issue above all others.  you cannot underestimate the impact of the war in iraq. we lost people from our local party who had some key roles.   but the two friends were fired up by gordon brown s speech on saturday  with its appeal to core labour values on social justice  health and education.   there was real passion. i think we have all felt a little jaded  but it reminded us why we joined the party in the first place   said mrs spence.  if he hadn t have walked off the stage  they would still be clapping   added mr lane. but for every brownite at the spring conference there was an equally ardent fan of mr blair. stephen douglas  26  from wales  said after the pm s speech on sunday:  i think it was a bit of a turning point  given the roasting he has had on some issues. the guy still has it.   tony martin  of burnley  said:  he is the first leader who has won us two terms. this bloke has delivered for us.  malcolm shipley  of shipley  said it was  as if he is coming round to the right approach again . katrina bull  a prospective parliamentary candidate said mr blair had shown he could rouse the party s grassroots:  i think if every voter was able to spend time in a room with tony  the way we have today  we will have no problem with turnout.  she had just emerged from a q&a session  in which mr blair - tieless and supremely at ease - answered questions posed via the party s website.  a party of councillors from nottingham agreed that there was nothing wrong with mr blair s leadership - and they were adamant that the campaigning strength of the party in their city was as strong as ever. iraq  they insisted  would not be a factor for most voters.  the biggest problem we have got at the moment is that we keep getting all these polls saying we are going to run away with the election.  it might sound great  but it does create this sense of complacency among our own voters and i think that is the greater problem than iraq   said nottingham city councillor brian parbutt. and even mr blair s most vocal critics seemed to agree on one thing - he is a master of the sort of glossy  high-profile campaigning that has become labour s hallmark  epitomised by friday s whistle-stop tour of marginal seats. a group of shop stewards from the swan hunter shipyard  who said they were facing redundancy  could barely suppress their anger at mr blair s failure to  as they saw it  shake off his tory leanings and stand up for manufacturing in the north east.  they were also scathing about the alleged benefits of showpiece projects such as conference venue sage centre  heralded by john prescott and others this weekend as a symbol of labour s success in urban regeneration.   it is no good having the sage or baltic if you haven t got the money for the entrance fee   said terry telford. but when asked about mr blair s bravura performance on friday  the men agreed he was  brilliant . and they would all be out on the doorstep pushing the labour message come election time.  if you are not fired up about the election  then what s the point  there is no complacency as far as i can see in the labour party. we are fired up. we are up for this election   said richie porterhouse. mr telford agreed  but added it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of an answer when people asked  what has labour done for the north east    i have had doors slammed in my face   he said.  every activist i spoke to said they were proud of what they believed labour had achieved in their local communities - the new hospitals and schools  the better life chances for young people. the problem they faced  they said  was converting this local feelgood factor into votes. but they could at least rely on one  secret weapon   as one activist put it - tory leader michael howard.,1.688879
21,tech,halo 2 heralds traffic explosion the growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms  warns network monitoring company sandvine.  it issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of halo 2. the 9 november traffic explosion has continued into december  said sandvine. service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth. as well as being a popular single-player title  halo 2 can be connected to microsoft s subscription-based broadband network  xbox live. gamers who want to play online can create their own clan  or team  and take on others to see how well they compare.  but the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic  said sandvine s chief technology officer marc morin.  in a bid to cope and ease congestion  providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent  finding out who is using bandwidth and for what. it could become common to charge people for the amount of bandwidth they use.  the explosion in xbox live traffic attributed to halo 2 should be seen as a clarion call   he said.  isps need to enhance the broadband experience for these high-end users by prioritising or reserving bandwidth for games   he added.  one of the main factors that spoils online gaming is  lag  in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world. gamers tend to migrate toward networks with the lowest  lag . analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth-hungry gamers said lindsay schroth  an analyst with research firm the yankee group.  in the competitive broadband environment  operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live-play gaming   she said. in countries such as korea  which has high levels of fast net connections to homes  online gaming is hugely popular.,1.56022

1289,tech,poles play with gameboy  blip-pop  a group of artists in poland has taken the cacophony of blips  boops and beeps created as players bash buttons on nintendo s handheld gameboy console to a new level.  the gameboyzz orchestra project has taken the game sounds to put together music tunes they have dubbed  blip-pop.  think of it as donkey kong meets norman cook  or maybe tetris takes on kraftwerk. any way you slice it  the sound is distinct. all the sounds are made by six nintendo gameboys  with a mixture of older models and newer advance sp handhelds. the gameboyzz orchestra project tweaks the software a bit  and then connects the units through a mixing board.  jarek kujda  one of the project s founding members has been into electronic music and video games  for a while now.   i was playing some experimental music and three  four years ago when i first used a gameboy in my band as a drum machine   said kujda. he realised that the console could be used as a rudimentary synthesizer. he wondered  if one gameboy can make music  what would happen if he put six of them together  kujda found five other people who were interested and the gameboyzz orchestra project was born.  gameboyzz orchestra project is more of an improvisational project   said kudja.  we prepare some patterns before a concert  and then improvise during the concert.  the group plays maybe four or five shows a year. malgorzata kujda  jarek s younger sister and a fellow band member  describes a gameboyzz orchestra project concert as a lot of noise.  for example  i make music with more hard beats and noises   she said.  but each of us makes another music  a different sound. and then in the concert we just improvise  and that i think is more fun for us.   the gameboyzz orchestra project admits they get mixed reactions from audiences. some love the group s music  and others are not quite sure what to make of it.  in the world of electronic music  these purveyors of blip-pop are not unique. but jarek kujda says they try to be unique.  we have lots of people making music on old school stuff  electronic old school stuff like commodore  atari  spectrum   he said.  we want to play only experimental music  not cover songs. we re something like an electronic jam session.  the gameboyzz orchestra project s tracks are available online and the group hopes to make a cd next year. and they have sponsorship  courtesy of the polish distributor of nintendo products. the members of the gameboyzz orchestra project do not expect serious competition anytime soon. a gameboy advance costs about us $200 in poland these days  which is still way beyond the reach of most polish gamers  or musicians.  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production,-2.4953747

1201,business,parmalat sues 45 banks over crash parmalat has sued 45 banks as it tries to reclaim money paid to banks before the scandal-hit italian dairy company went bust last year.  the firm collapsed with debts of about 14bn euros ($19bn; £10bn) and new boss enrico bondi has already taken legal action against a number of lenders. he claims the banks were aware of the problems but continued to work with the company so they could earn commissions. parmalat has not identified which banks it has gone after this time. under italian law  administrators can seek to get back money paid to financial institutions prior to insolvency  if there is a suspicion that the institutions knew that the company was in financial trouble. the firm also said it is preparing further law suits.  according to the reuters news agency  35 of the companies sued on thursday are italian while the remaining 10 are international. the unidentified parmalat source also told reuters that the company was planning to take action against a total of 80 financial institutions. among those already targeted are bank of america  ubs  credit suisse first boston  deutsche bank and citigroup. it has also gone after auditors grant thornton. they have all denied any wrongdoing. parmalat was declared insolvent in december 2003 after it emerged that 4bn euros thought to be held in an offshore account did not in fact exist. in the investigation that followed it became apparent that the company  among other things  had been billing clients twice in order to boost sales and bolster the balance sheet. that enabled parmalat to borrow heavily and expand overseas  allowing it to become a darling of the italian stock exchange.,0.15405893
109,tech,web radio takes spanish rap global spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanish-language music. but what you will not find is much spanish-language hip-hop.  hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanish-speaking world  but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. but now  a us company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. los caballeros de plan g are one of mexico s hottest hip-hop acts. they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey. but most mexican hip-hop fans  not to mention fans in most of the spanish-speaking world  rarely get a chance to hear the group s tracks on the radio.   you can t really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in spanish... it s just not accessible   says manuel millan  a native of san diego  california.  it s really hard for the spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.  millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally.  mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music  and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. so  millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. the name says it all: it is web-based radio  devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. the site  which is in both in english and spanish  is meant to be easy to navigate. all the user has to do is download a media player. there are no djs. it is just music streamed over the net for free. suddenly  with the help of the website  los caballeros de plan g are producing  export quality  rap.  the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip-hop right now. the genre is in what millan calls its  infant stage . but the production values are improving  and artists such as argentina s mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better. mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com.  he s considered the eminem of argentina  and the latin american hip-hop scene   millan says.  he really hasn t had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world  but he s definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish-speaking world.  currently  the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com s top 10  as is cuban artist papo record.  every country s got it s own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs   millan says. latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world. right now  mexico leads the way  accounting for about 50% of listeners. but web surfers in spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station s traffic comes from there. that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanish-language rap and hip-hop. millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. that might be changing  though  as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences.  but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com s top 10. his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in spain. on his track uno contra veinte emcees  or one against 20 emcees  tote king shows he is well aware of that fact.  it s basically him bragging that he s one of the best emcees in spain right now   millan says.  and it s pretty much true. he has the tightest productions  and his rap flow is impeccable  it s amazing.  latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hip-hop and rap.  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.,-3.7489595

251,sport,federer joins all-time greats the last year has seen one player dominate men s tennis  and one country dominate the women s game.  roger federer became the first man since mats wilander in 1988 to win three grand slams in one season. and after anastasia myskina became the first russian woman to win a grand slam at the french open  two more followed at wimbledon and the us open. meanwhile  briton tim henman enjoyed his best year  while greg rusedski fought back superbly from adversity. federer began the year as world number one and holder of the wimbledon and masters cup titles  and set about conquering new ground. the swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the australian open.  he ripped through the draw before beating marat safin in the final. andy roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at wimbledon  and federer s performance against lleyton hewitt in the us open final was breathtaking. federer again got the better of hewitt in the season-ending masters cup. his victory in houston proved to be his 13th successive win in a final  an open era record. the only major let-down was a third-round loss to gustavo kuerten at the french open  and roland garros will be his main target in 2005.  there was also a surprise loss to the unheralded tomas berdych at the olympic games  which saw chile dominate as nicoals massu took the singles and then paired up with fernando gonzaelz to win doubles gold. another major trophy that looks beyond federer is the davis cup  which was won by spain in a 3-2 home success over the usa in seville. roddick struggled on the clay  losing to rafael nadal on the opening day before going down to carlos moya in the all-important fourth rubber.  henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the french open - a stunning effort - and also at the us open. a quarter-final defeat to mario ancic at wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the briton s defeat  but he remains optimistic of going further next year.  british number two rusedski endured a rollercoaster year  returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in march. with his ranking down at 168  many feared the 31-year-old s career was over  but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top 50. the russian women finally delivered on their long-recognised promise in 2004  with myskina  maria sharapova and svetlana kuznetsova winning grand slams  before taking the season-ending fed cup. but while the young russians were on the way up  it was a different story for the belgians and the williams sisters. only veteran lindsay davenport held the new wave at bay  a stunning run of form after wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of amelie mauresmo  whose grand slam drought goes on. the year started in regulation fashion as justine henin-hardenne beat compatriot kim clijsters at the australian open.  a virus ruined the rest of henin-hardenne s year  although she was fit enough to win olympic gold  but clijsters had an even more miserable 2004. she suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with lleyton hewitt  and will be happy to see the year end. in their absence  myskina thrashed elena dementieva in a historic  but woeful  all-russian final at the french open. wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as sharapova captivated sw19  showing nerves of steel as she battled past davenport and serena williams to take the title.  davenport was a strong favourite for the us open but  hampered by injury  lost to the powerful and unflappable kuznetsova in the semis. kuznetsova went on to give dementieva another grand slam final thrashing  with the latter s wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year. with the russians still improving  the likes of henin-hardenne  clijsters  davenport  mauresmo  venus and serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005. and it may take their compatriot safin to challenge federer on the men s side.,-0.4828391

359,politics,baa support ahead of court battle uk airport operator baa has reiterated its support for the government s aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.  the comments come a day ahead of a high court challenge by residents  groups and local councils to the government s white paper. the judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at heathrow  stansted and luton airports. baa  which operates all three  said it was consulting with local communities.  we are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations   a baa spokesman said.  groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion  heathrow anti-noise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth. at heathrow  gatwick  edinburgh and glasgow airports  baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september 2004  which will close next week. the company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked  unblighted price. among other measures  baa has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near stansted  and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. at heathrow  baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental  air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.  at gatwick  the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. stop stansted expansion said the white paper  published in december 2003  was  fundamentally flawed  and did not follow the proper consultation process.  we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government white paper   said stop stansted expansion chairman peter sanders said. hacan chairman john stewart said:  almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation white paper with much fanfare.  it hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation.  yet  a year later the protesters are still here  and stronger than ever.   a judgement from mr justice sullivan is expected early in february.,0.12811184
721,tech,no re-draft  for eu patent law a proposed european law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the european commission (ec) despite requests by meps.  the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions  while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review  all aspects of the directive . the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect  in other words   computer implemented invention .  in a letter  ec president jos&#233; manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament  josep borrell  that the commission  did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council (of ministers)  as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004.  if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament. but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law. french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament s request it would be an  insult  to the assembly. he said that the parliament would then reject the council s version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. in the us  the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted.  this means that the us-based amazon.com holds a patent for its  one-click shopping  service  for example. critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe. this  they fear  could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us.,3.7102728

consumer   said an eton spokesperson.  we are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.  the porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of january in the us and in the first quarter of 2005 in the uk. in the us is it expected to cost $250 (£133).      the average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the consumer electronics association  the organisation behind ces. this is expected to grow to a massive 3 420 images - or 7.2gb - in five years  time. one gadget that might help swell that collection is sanyo s tiny handheld vpc-c4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. it combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. it takes mpeg4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. images and video are stored on sd cards  which have come down in price in recent months. a 512mb card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. the device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. because images and video are stored on sd memory  it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too.      wearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. mpio s tiny digital usb music players come in an array of fashionable colours  taking a leaf out of the apple ipod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. slung on a cord  the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. although the pendant design was launched three months ago  the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends. an even dinkier model  the fy500  comes out in may and will store about 256mb of music. the range of players recently won an international forum design award 2005.,1.3221517

1990,politics,tories opposing 24-hour drinking the tories say plans to extend pub opening times should be put on hold until binge drinking is under control  despite backing a law change last year.  spokesman david davis said ministers had failed to make his party aware of concern among senior police that plans would cause more anti-social behaviour. notts police chief steve green said innocent people would suffer. but culture secretary tessa jowell said a delay would be  disastrous  and she accused the tories of opportunism. the government would go ahead with the changes which would give police more power to tackle excessive drinking  she added. earlier chief constable green questioned how his officers would be able to practically apply powers allowing them to shut down problem premises.  if you look at the market square in nottingham  if a fight takes place which licensed premises do you go and lay the responsibilty at the door of   he asked on bbc radio 4 s world at one programme.  he warned that if drinking establishments were allowed to open until three or four in the morning the police would have to take officers off day shifts in order to do their job effectively at night. earlier this year the royal college of physicians said it opposed the plan to extend drinking hours when there was already an  epidemic  of binge drinking. minister richard caborn said the government was tackling the causes and the symptoms of the problem by allowing more powers to close down problem premises. it is hoped that allowing pubs and clubs to stay open longer will stagger closing times and end the current situation where drinkers spill on to the streets all at once. earlier tony blair defended the plans against criticism from one of his own backbenchers.   my view of this is very clear: we should have the same flexibility that other countries have and then we should come down really hard on those who abuse that freedom and don t show the responsibility   he told mps.  the law-abiding majority who want the ability  after going to the cinema or theatre say  to have a drink at the time they want should not be inconvenienced  we shouldn t have to have restrictions that no other city in europe has  just in order to do something for that tiny minority who abuse alcohol  who go out and fight and cause disturbances.  to take away that ability for all the population - even the vast majority who are law abiding - is not  in my view  sensible.  this week a judge claimed easy access to drink was breeding  urban savages  and turning town centres into no go areas. judge charles harris qc made his remarks as he sentenced three men for assaults carried out while drunk and high on drugs after a night out.,1.2020378
748,politics,tv debate urged for party chiefs broadcasters should fix a date for a pre-election televised debate between the three main political leaders  according to the hansard society.  it would then be up to tony blair  michael howard and charles kennedy to decide whether to take part  the non-partisan charity said. chairman lord holme argued that prime ministers should not have the right of veto on a matter  of public interest .  the broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead   he said.  lord holme s proposal for a televised debate comes just four months after millions of viewers were able to watch us president george w bush slug it out verbally with his democratic challenger john kerry. he said it was a  democratically dubious proposition  that it was up to the incumbent prime minister to decide whether a similar event takes place here.  if mr blair did not want to take part  the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why  lord holme said.  what makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although mr howard and mr kennedy have said they would welcome a debate  no-one has heard directly from the prime minister   he said.  it has been left to nudges and winks  hints and briefings from his aides and campaign managers to imply that mr blair doesn t want one  but we haven t heard from the prime minister himself.   lord holme  who has campaigned for televised debates at previous elections  said broadcasters were  more than willing to cooperate with the arrangements . opinion polls suggested that the idea had the backing of the public who like comparing the personalities and policies of the contenders in their own homes  he said.  lord holme argued that as part of their public service obligations  broadcasters  should make the decision to go ahead  as soon as the election is called. an independent third-party body such as the hansard society or electoral commission could work out the ground rules so they were fair to participants and informative to the public  he said.  it would be up to each party leader to accept or refuse   said lord holme.   if the prime minister s reported position is true and he does want to take part  he would then be obliged to say why publicly.  the broadcasters would then have the option of cancelling the event for obvious and well-understood reasons  or going ahead with an empty chair.  either way would be preferable to the present hidden veto.  the hansard society has long campaigned for televised debates and has published reports on the issue in 1997 and 2001. tony blair has already ruled out taking part in a televised debate during the forthcoming election campaign. last month he said:  we answer this every election campaign and  for the reasons i have given before  the answer is no   he said at his monthly news conference.,1.8822353
164,politics,ukip candidate suspended eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.  john houston  54  was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. but he was suspended after his reported views  including the return of the british empire  were sent to two scottish newspapers. ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views. the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip  soon after the high-profile departure of mep robert kilroy-silk. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be  made available to law-abiding members of the community  and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. the document reportedly said:  we re looking for the resurrection of the british empire.  the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale  and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations  which they are uniquely able to do.  mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston s reported views had been presented as ukip policy  which they were not. he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party s manifesto  but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate. he told bbc news:  he appears to have said these things. we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate.  by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting.  it is simply a distraction from the task in hand  the eu constitution  not individual idiocies.  mr houston was quoted in the herald newspaper saying:  i feel ukip have over-reacted and overshot the runway.   peter nielson  who is ukip scotland chairman  said he had suspended mr houston on friday night.  he will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken.  he said that any evidence would be looked into and mr houston may be interviewed by the party. he added:  i can t comment too much at the moment  i have one version from him but i haven t seen the papers yet.,0.93674135
1495,business,asian quake hits european shares shares in europe s leading reinsurers and travel firms have fallen as the scale of the damage wrought by tsunamis across south asia has become apparent.  more than 23 000 people have been killed following a massive underwater earthquake and many of the worst hit areas are popular tourist destinations. reisurance firms such as swiss re and munich re lost value as investors worried about rebuilding costs. but the disaster has little impact on stock markets in the us and asia.  currencies including the thai baht and indonesian rupiah weakened as analysts warned that economic growth may slow.  it came at the worst possible time   said hans goetti  a singapore-based fund manager.  the impact on the tourist industry is pretty devastating  especially in thailand.  travel-related shares dropped in europe  with companies such as germany s tui and lufthansa and france s club mediterranne sliding. insurers and reinsurance firms were also under pressure in europe.  shares in munich re and swiss re - the world s two biggest reinsurers - both fell 1.7% as the market speculated about the cost of rebuilding in asia. zurich financial  allianz and axa also suffered a decline in value.  however  their losses were much smaller  reflecting the market s view that reinsurers were likely to pick up the bulk of the costs. worries about the size of insurance liabilities dragged european shares down  although the impact was exacerbated by light post-christmas trading. germany s benchmark dax index closed the day 16.29 points lower at 3.817.69 while france s cac index of leading shares fell 5.07 points to 3.817.69. investors pointed out  however  that declines probably would be industry specific  with the travel and insurance firms hit hardest.  it s still too early for concrete damage figures   swiss re s spokesman floiran woest told associated press.  that also has to do with the fact that the damage is very widely spread geographically.   the unfolding scale of the disaster in south asia had little immediate impact on us shares  however. the dow jones index had risen 20.54 points  or 0.2%  to 10 847.66 by late morning as analsyts were cheered by more encouraging reports from retailers about post-christmas sales. in asian markets  adjustments were made quickly to account for lower earnings and the cost of repairs. thai airways shed almost 4%. the country relies on tourism for about 6% of its total economy. singapore airlines dropped 2.6%. about 5% of singapore s annual gross domestic product (gdp) comes from tourism. malaysia s budget airline  airasia fell 2.9%. resort operator tanco holdings slumped 5%.  travel companies also took a hit  with japan s kinki nippon sliding 1.5% and his dropping 3.3%. however  the overall impact on asia s largest stock market  japan s nikkei  was slight. shares fell just 0.03%. concerns about the strength of economic growth going forward weighed on the currency markets. the indonesian rupiah lost as much as 0.6% against the us dollar  before bouncing back slightly to trade at 9 300. the thai baht lost 0.3% against the us currency  trading at 39.10. in india  where more than 2 000 people are thought to have died  the rupee shed 0.1% against the dollar analysts said that it was difficult to predict the total cost of the disaster and warned that share prices and currencies would come under increasing pressure as the bills mounted.,2.0733147
565,politics,howard attacks  pay later  budget tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon brown s budget as  vote now  pay later  spending plans.  the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole  mr howard said. everyone could see the chancellor s  sweeteners   but these hid tax rises for hard working families  he said. labour s  faltering election campaign  would not be helped by the package of measures  mr howard added.  mr brown s budget was not about what was good for the country  but  all about the interests of the labour party   the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign. he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other. he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging  millions of people in to the net  to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax.  we can all see the sweeteners  but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if labour wins.   he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced.  their only answer is to tax  to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later.  mr brown liked to rattle off  magical balances conjured out of thin air  in a bid to convince people there was no  black hole  in the nation s finances  the tory leader said.  this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers   he said.  you now propose to borrow  over the next six years  no less than £168 billion; so much for prudence.  the chancellor s forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister s forecasts of weapons of mass destruction.   mr brown s council tax rebate for pensioners was £300 less than what the tories were offering  mr howard said. there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets  make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools. people would face a  clear choice  at the election  either  more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives   he said.  that s the battleground of this election. that s what this election is going to be all about and i say bring it on   he concluded  to loud tory cheering.,1.8682847
1744,politics,brown to outline presidency goals next year will be  make or break  for development in poorer countries gordon brown will say as he sets out uk goals for its eu and g8 presidencies.  the chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005. they will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. mr brown also wants other g8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.  he also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for aids and malaria. the chancellor is travelling to america next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. he told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  we need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health  of illiteracy  of poverty  particularly in africa but right through the developing countries.   his proposals were effectively a new  marshall plan  for the world  including an international finance facility  which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year. agreement in the doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed  he argued. the european union s common agricultural policy had caused aggravated trade problems  he said  but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies.  mr brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years. but with 30 000 children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed  including 100% debt relief multilaterally.  that is why next year is a test   he said.  if after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them  then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results.  the catholic aid agency cafod will host mr brown s speech on wednesday.  cafod wants britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the us to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty. mr brown said america too needed to take more action but defended president george bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption. oxfam s paying the price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels. the charity s director  barbara stocking  said:  2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough  but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure.  the report said the g8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.  but 34 years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable. mr blair  who has described africa as a  scar  on the world s conscience  has already said tackling world poverty would be one his g8 priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic. but band aid founder bob geldof in july said he was sick of hearing  guff  about scars on the world. it was pathetic that britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor  he added. conservative shadow international development secretary alan duncan accused mr brown of missing his target on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million africans by 2005. instead  only 500 000 people would benefit  he said.  there s no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has   added mr duncan.,1.4750962
796,tech,uk broadband gets speed injection broadband s rapid rise continues apace as speeds gear up a notch.  an eight megabit service has been launched by internet service provider uk online. it is 16 times faster than the average broadband package on the market and will pave the way for services such as video-on-demand and broadband tv. the service is possible due to a new regime which allows other operators to use bt s exchanges and will initially only be available in towns.  it represents a  big leap forward  for broadband  said chris stening  uk online general manager.  the service comes with a hefty £39.99 monthly price tag but will mean users can download mp3s in seconds and offers tv-quality video streaming. the service includes wifi as standard  meaning users can connect multiple pcs  laptops and game consoles from any room in the house. not everybody will be able to take advantage of the service  as it will be restricted to metropolitan areas. the service will initially be available to users within 2km radius of 230 telephone exchanges in areas such as london  birmingham  glasgow and cambridge. that represents about 4.4 million households. the service is possible due to a decision to loosen bt s strangle-hold on telephone exchanges.  the process  known as local loop unbundling  was put in motion by the now defunct telecoms watchdog oftel but has only proved popular in recent months due to falling costs. uk online is looking at the possibility of bundling services such as cheap net telephone calls  video-on-demand and tv by 2005 if the service proves popular.  the service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the uk and 16 times faster than most broadband services   said mr stening.  it takes a big leap for broadband and we are very excited about it   he said. countries such as south korea and france have found the advantage of upping the speeds of broadband. in south korea  video-on-demand over the net is cheaper than renting a dvd and online gaming is huge. mr stening believes the service will appeal to people in multi-occupancy buildings as well as easing family arguments.  a typical family with two adults and two children is currently sharing a 512 kilobit service. this will basically give them 2 megabits each   he said.,2.4911273

797,tech,kenyan school turns to handhelds at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus.  they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. it is a pilot project run by eduvision  which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e-slates.  the e-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. the data is transmitted alongside audio signals.  the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld e-slates.  it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream  sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. it also stores this on its hard disc.   the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project.  it s very simple to set up  just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school  but it s also a one-way connection  so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult.   the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linux-based system.  the content is divided into visual information  textual information and questions. users can scroll through these sections independently of each other.  eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world s largest university libraries.  all books in the public domain  something like 15 million  could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them. then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard  currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity. but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions.  we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station  have the e-slates charge during the day when the children are in school  then they can take them home at night and continue working.  maciej sundra  who designed the user interface for the e-slates  says the project s ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world.  why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks  the fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting - as they need it most.,-2.182228

597,entertainment,dvd review: harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban this third harry potter film brought a change of director and a dramatic visual shake-up that really shines on dvd.  gone are the warm  bright colours found in the two earlier films  alfonso cuaron brings in a bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous - and looks even better here than in the cinema. it is all part of the progression of harry s story into darker areas  but you ll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful hogwarts landscape.  this is the first potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book. it is the third year at hogwarts and studies are interrupted  as they always are  by a calamity that only harry  ron and hermione can put right.  it sounds corny. but harry is no longer the winsome hero  he is a moody teenager and daniel radcliffe pulls it off very well. emma watson is ever better as hermione  and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including gary oldman and emma thompson. the film itself is the reason to buy this dvd. but it is laden with behind-the-scenes extras  including funny  if shallow  interviews with all the main cast. but what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch. younger viewers will go for the games which include a magic you may have missed memory test  and crookshanks chasing off after scabbers. adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes. you will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage - and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it  as we did on the first harry potter dvd. the most interesting pieces are an interview with jk rowling in creating the vision and conjuring a scene  a short featurette about the making of the film s big moments.,-3.4093475

2030,business,uk young top euro earnings league british children enjoy the highest average annual income in europe - more than double that of spanish or italian youngsters  a report suggests.  children in the uk between the ages of 10 and 17 had an annual income of £775  said market analyst datamonitor. they use  pester power  to get their parents to stump up nearly a third of this income  the report said. as for how they spend their cash  the bulk goes on personal care  soft drinks and food  datamonitor said.  datamonitor adds that british teenagers are keen on personal care because it helps them combine two seemingly contradictory emotional needs - the desire to fit in and the desire to express their individuality.  british teenage girls  compared to their counterparts in seven european countries  are the most keen to use make-up products. nearly three out of four girls said they used make-up. according to the datamonitor report the trend marked british teenagers out as  particularly important to cosmetics manufacturers as they are likely to experiment more with brands and products and form long-term beauty routines . and the good times are likely to keep rolling for british children  as the report predicts that they will still be topping the earnings table in 2008.,0.4627018
192,politics,blair  said he would stand down  tony blair promised gordon brown he would stand down before the next election  a new book about the chancellor claims.  but the prime minister changed his mind following intervention from allies in the cabinet  according to the book. the book by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston said the pair had  mutual animosity and contempt  for each other. the book  brown s britain  said tony blair felt by november 2003 he had lost voters  trust.  the author s sources  all unnamed  allies  of mr blair and mr brown  said the prime minister felt the iraq war had undermined him and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party.  the book  serialised in the sunday telegraph  alleges that mr blair told the chancellor at a dinner hosted by deputy pm john prescott in november 2003 of his intention to stand down.  at that stage he saw gordon brown and said   look you are the next most influential member of the government  i need your help to get through the next year   mr peston said.  i myself recognise that i m going to have to stand down before the election but help me to get through the year and i will then stand down.   but he changed his mind in june 2004  following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him  the book claims.  mr peston told bbc news:  my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were.  what the book says is there now a pretty profound mutual mistrust  mutual animosity.  i think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private i don t think the relationship is good because brown  understandably  feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership.  there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently  following their separate responses to the asian tsunami. rumours of a rift were fuelled by the sudden decision to hold mr blair s monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new  marshall plan  for africa. there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other s response to the disaster.  former welfare minister frank field mp criticised the reported rivalry between the pair on gmtv s sunday programme.   what sort of model does it give to the nation when the two most important political leaders do nothing but fight it out together or use their aides to fight it out   the labour mp for birkenhead asked. he said the prime minister should sack mr brown  but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so. conservative policy co-ordinator david cameron  mp for witney  added:  if it wasn t so serious it would be funny.  but it is serious - you ve got the two most senior people in the government not concentrating on fighting crime  poverty or dirty hospitals - they are fighting each other.  carol walker  bbc news 24 political correspondent  added:  there is a real concern that this could undermine the general election campaign.  and clearly it is very bad news for the government at a time when it is trying to explain what it is doing to respond to the terrible problems thrown up by the tsunami disaster.,1.3013644
1764,tech,nintendo ds aims to touch gamers the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. market leader nintendo  however  is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played.  the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks. far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld  it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens  and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen.  the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm s pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market.  nintendo first launched its gameboy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since. but its lead can no longer be taken for granted. sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable  while start-up companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices.  we believe the ds will appeal to all ages  both genders and gamers of any skill   said david yarnton  nintendo europe s general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. with its two screens  wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance  the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points. it went on sale in the us in mid-november priced $150 and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations  without giving detailed figures. japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device. with more than two million pre-orders for the device in japan  nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot. but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed  the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters - a 3d action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine s wireless capabilities. it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people.  the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. super mario 64 ds is a faithful re-creation of the nintendo 64 classic with a host of new mini-games and new levels. the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. one thing is for certain. hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices  ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds s key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up. the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks.,-1.9950075
585,tech,football manager scores big time for the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of championship manager (cm). indeed  it seems like there has been a cm game for as many years as there have been pcs.  however  last year was the final time that developers sports interactive (si) and publishers eidos would work together. they decided to go their separate ways  and each kept a piece of the franchise. si kept the game s code and database  and eidos retained rights to the cm brand  and the look and feel of the game. so at the beginning of this year  fans faced a new situation. eidos announced the next cm game  with a new team to develop it from scratch  whilst si developed the existing code further to be released  with new publishers sega  under the name football manager. so what does this mean  well  football manager is the spiritual successor to the cm series  and it has been released earlier than expected. at this point cm5 looks like it will ship early next year. but given that football manager 2005 is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves  how does this new version shape up   a game like fm2005 could blind you with statistics. it has an obscene number of playable leagues  an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database  with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans. but that does not do justice to the game really. what we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the earth.  you begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from  for instance england and scotland. that will give you a choice not just of the four main scottish leagues  but the english premiership all the way down to the conference north and south. of course you might be looking for european glory  or to get hold of abramovich s millions  in which case you can take control at chelsea  or even barcelona  real madrid  ac milan ... the list goes on a very long way. once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you. sometimes it is promotion  or a place in europe  sometimes it is consolidation or a brave relegation battle. it might even be a case of champions or else. obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose  so choose wisely. then it is time to look at your squad  work out your tactics  seeing how much cash  if any  you have got to splash  having a look at the transfer market  sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it. then bring on the matches  which are once more available in the ever-improving top down 2d view. with the exception of the improved user interface on the surface  not much else seems to have changed.  however  there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well - things like the manager mind-games  which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses. the match engine is also much improved  and it is more of a joy than ever to watch. in fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked  and it leads to an ever more immersive experience.  with a game that is so complex and so open-ended  there are of course a few glitches  but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases. with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches  though there have been improvements in this area. and a sport like football  which is so high profile and unpredictable itself  can never be modelled quite to everybody s satisfaction. but this time around a great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only  and do not affect gameplay. and if there are problems further down the line  sports interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible. in all there are many more tweaks and improvements. if you were a fan of the previous cm games  then fm2005 might make you forget there was anything else before it. if you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take margate into the premiership  spurs into europe  or even putting rangers back on the top of the tree  fm2005 could be the best purchase you ever made. just be warned that the family might not see you much at christmas.  football manager 2005 out now for the pc and the mac,-1.514389

1383,politics,brown comes out shooting labour may have abolished hunting - but that didn t stop chancellor gordon brown using his budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties  core election foxes.  specifically  it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families. in a relatively short speech he kept the best for last and was clearly out to give exactly that pre-election boost everyone had been predicting. so if you are a couple with children  a pensioner  a patient or a youngster  there was something pulled from mr brown s red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a new labour government. like a surgeon  he attempted to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the groups the government needs to appeal to in the election campaign.  the announcements brought great cheers from his own mps who are now in full-on election mode and had been looking to their man to give them ammunition for the doorsteps. they obviously believed he had done that for them and  coincidentally  given his own image as a prime minister-in-waiting another little boost.  labour mps  for example  will undoubtedly now engage in a debate over exactly how redistributive - a lovely old labour word - this chancellor really is. but gordon brown is never going to put on a show and even as he was out to cast himself as the man who will win labour an historic third term  his demeanour remained quiet  confident and reassuring. prudence made an appearance  albeit towards the end of his address  as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to britain and which  he claimed  would be thrown away by anyone else. according to the opposition parties  however  it is all one big con trick.  as always  they accused him of glossing over the facts of the  black hole  at the centre of his finances which  they claim  would ensure tax increases after the election. he did it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the 2001 election campaign during which he had pledged not to increase income tax. as liberal democrat leader charles kennedy claimed  for most families the distinction between income tax and a tax on income is meaningless.  tory leader michael howard said the chancellor was up to his old trick of deliberately re-casting his forecasts to give the illusion that everything in the treasury larder is as fresh as the day it was first stored away for future use. he branded it a dodgy  vote now pay later  budget based on dodgy figures from a dodgy government that gave britain the dodgy dossier. where the chancellor mostly avoided direct electioneering  mr howard felt no such constraint with attacks like comparing mr brown s forecasts to the prime minister s forecasts on iraq s weapons of mass destruction. as ever  there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties  treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellor s red book  which sets out the fine detail of his budget  in an attempt to spot the flaws. in particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal. and in labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister gordon brown will make at some point after the next election.,1.6864893

1704,tech,brainwave  cap controls computer a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer.  four people  two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users  successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences.  the results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions   said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane. the research team  from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany  said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought.  the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which  meant no surgery or implantation was needed.  brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles  so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively.  the impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm  a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis   said the researchers. the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall  the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments. some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. earlier this year  a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.,4.4876266

257,tech,sporting rivals go to extra time the current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on-field action without ever moving from the couch.  the two giants in the field - espn and ea sports - have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years. the latter is the world s largest games manufacturer. years of experience mean that the titles in their steady flow of sport sims are finely honed  massively entertaining and ooze flair. sports broadcaster espn  meanwhile  has leant its name to a series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price. but that status quo was changed forever - or for the next 15 years at least - by a deal earlier this year when espn sold ea the rights to its tv branding and on-air talent  meaning the espn games presently developed by sega will have to come to and end in their present form.  it was a massive-money deal that not only raised eyebrows but stirred active indignation in many quarters  with fans concerned that it is set to enable ea to monopolise the sports gaming landscape to an unhealthy degree. some particularly disgruntled fans set up an online petition that notched more than 18 000 virtual signatures. many of those clicking to complain were already rankled  for the espn coup happened just weeks after ea had pulled off another enormous licensing deal  controversially giving them exclusive rights to teams and personnel from america&#191;s national football league (nfl). so  will the sega - espn range be missed  a key reason for answering  yes  is that liking or disliking a sports game regularly comes down to personal taste  and having some options available always proves hugely handy. online soccer fans will testify to that  between bouts of arguing over which high-profile title rules supreme out of the similar-yet-hugely-different fifa 2005 and pro evolution soccer 4. on the same note  the espn 2k5 and ea sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players  personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements. taking hockey and basketball as examples  both publishers  efforts are phenomenally entertaining and fairly accessible. they also both look awesome  with the sega / espn versions perhaps shading things on a graphical front.  in terms of gameplay  i marginally preferred ea s nba live 2005 for basketball  and was more satisfied ice hockey-wise by espn s nhl 2k5. the espn games are a touch more arcade-like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into  although like their rivals  they also offer a dizzyingly-extensive array of in-game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die-hard of sports fans. perhaps the most interesting aspect of the espn deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of ea s future titles. the front-end decoration of ea s games has become something of an art-form in itself  loaded with slick visuals and oodles of licensed music. they are also immediately identifiable as coming from the ea stable  and the inevitable compulsion to add an espn look will no doubt change that in various ways. what is a shame is that the espn titles took similar care about framing the gameplay with an authentic setting - their preambles look and sound much like they would on tv. they are neat and excellent-value games in their current form  and combining them with ea s own established brand should produce a truly formidable beast.,-3.2096224

581,sport,reaction from spanish press england s 1-0 defeat to spain on wednesday dominated the back and front pages of the country s press on thursday.  controversy was in no short supply  with racist abuse of england s black players  wayne rooney s petulance and england s inept performance. but what did the spanish press make of the affair  bbc sport looks at the reaction.      there is little coverage of the racist chanting on wednesday night s game. but as does cover the english reaction to the pre-match comments from spain coach luis aragones  who highlighted britain s colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding thierry henry in october. journalist guillem balague writes:  in our country  where multi-culturalism is a new thing  we are in nappies dealing with these things  and have a naivety which makes the english nervous.   marca refers in passing to the booing of england s black players - but only after referring to the cheers of  ole  which greeted the long periods of spanish possession. aragones   no comment  to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted  as marca focuses on the spanish coach s praise for his players. serbia & montenegro s 2-0 world cup qualifying win in belgium - which could make qualification tougher for spain - seems to be of greater importance.  elsewhere  the spanish media criticises its english counterparts for stoking up the racism issue.  were there racist chants against some players  this hasn t happened in the spanish league and spain for many years   said spanish federation press officer fernando garrido.  so you (english reporters) should ask yourselves what you have done to contribute to all this.  and spanish daily abc accuses english reporters of launching a witch-hunt against aragones.  perhaps it was because their team had played so poorly and they wanted to divert attention towards this muddled issue   the paper says.       what the boy in the bernabeu did was odd... rooney seemed intent to kick any spanish player who approached him.  yet rooney is seen only as the worst example of many england miscreants  with gary neville criticised for continuing the feud between manchester united and arsenal for his tackles on jose reyes. ashley cole s treatment of joaquin  and a frank lampard foul on reyes are also lambasted for their  ugliness .  marca s headline says it all:  wayne rooney se volvi&#243; loco en el bernab&#233;u (wayne rooney became crazy in the bernabeu)  rooney s display alarms the writer  in particular three  chilling  fouls on joaquin  casillas and marchena  which  could well have left them in the infirmary.  and like as  marca criticises gary neville for  leaving a message on reyes  ankle  to remind him of the manchester united-arsenal clash this month.      spain s first-half performance is showered with praise  with xavi singled out as the biggest star.  xavi did things on wednesday which were worthy of maradona   the paper beams  adding   what a work-rate  what dynamism  what vision  what leadership  what a midfield player!  on a controversial evening  as offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint:  spanish football players played better football than the english.   more plaudits are given to the home team  with jaime vargas lauding the manner in which  spain dominated england with order and quality . the paper adds:  the bad thing about spain v england was that it lasted only 65 minutes after which a succession of changes prevented any real competition.  vargas does not mention england s two galacticos  simply adding in a ps:  i have not forgotten to speak of beckham and owen. they forgot to play.,-1.3610234
1258,business,honda wins china copyright ruling japan s honda has won a copyright case in beijing  further evidence that china is taking a tougher line on protecting intellectual property rights.  a court ruled that chongqing lifan industry group must stop selling honda brand motorbikes and said it must pay 1.47m yuan ($177 600) in compensation. internationally recognized regulation is now a key part of china s plans for developing its economy  analysts said. beijing also has been threatened with sanctions if it fails to clamp down.  chinese firms copy products ranging from computer software and spark plugs to baby milk and compact discs. despite the fact that product piracy is a major problem  foreign companies have only occasionally won cases and the compensation awarded has usually been small. still  recent rulings and announcements will have boosted optimism that attitudes are changing. earlier this week china said that in future it will punish violators of intellectual property rights with up to seven years in jail. and on tuesday  paws incorporated - the owner of the rights to garfield the cat - won a court battle against a publishing house that violated its copyright. other firms that have taken legal action in china  with varying degrees of success  include yamaha  general motors and toyota.  the problem of piracy is not limited to china  however  and the potential for profit is huge. the european union estimates that the global trade in pirated wares is worth more than 200bn euros a year (£140bn; $258bn)  or about 5% of total world trade. and it is growing. between 1998 and 2002  the number of counterfeit or pirated goods intercepted at the eu s external borders increased by more than 800%  it said. last month the eu said it will start monitoring china  ukraine and russia to ensure they are going after pirated goods. other countries on the eu s hit list include thailand  brazil  south korea and indonesia. any countries that are not making enough of an effort could be dragged to the world trade organisation (wto)  a step that could trigger economic sanctions  the eu warned.,0.4699149

142,tech,apple mac mini gets warm welcome the mac mini has been welcomed by apple fans  industry experts and pc users.  the release of the tiny  low-cost machine is seen as a good move for apple which currently has a small share of the desktop computer market. mac watchers and some analysts say the mac mini will go a long way to help apple appeal to the mass of consumers. they speculate that the mac mini will be bought by ipod owners and those wanting an easy-to-use and administer second home computer.   it s the bravest move they have made yet   said jonny evans  news editor at macworld magazine. mr evans said the combination of low cost  small size and huge numbers of ipod users could make it a big success.  he thought that the machine would appeal to those that like apple technology but who before now have balked at paying high prices for its hardware.  it s deeply affordable   he said.  plus you know that you do not get viruses or all of the associated problems.  already  he said  pc owning friends had declared that they would be buying one. interest in the new products launched at macworld expo was so strong that websites for apple s store and the show struggled to cope with demand. according to response statistics gathered by netcraft many visiting the apple store in the wake of mr jobs  speech suffered lengthy response times. the macworld expo site was completely overwhelmed and went offline.   i think fundamentally it s a good idea because it s cheap even for a pc   said nick ross  deputy labs editor at pc pro. apple s work on making things easy to use would also help the mac mini win fans  he said.  i think people expect it just to work now and really it should   hesaid. the mac mini could find a role in homes that need a second computer that is easy to install and administer  he said.  for browsing the web  e-mail and all kinds of basic duties it s going to be absolutely adequate   said mr ross. ian fogg  broadband and personal technology analyst at jupiter research  agreed that the mac mini could be very popular.  apple has been hoping that sales of the ipod will have a halo effect on the sales of the mac   he said.  before now  he said  apple has been seen as a premium brand. but  he said  the mac mini changed that perception.  it s a particularly good price when you see that it s apple that is doing it   he said. apple expects the mac mini to sell for £339 in the uk and $499 in the us. adding extras such as a larger hard drive  more memory and networking options will increase the basic price. it will go on sale from 22 january.  for consumers interested in style  design and small size - which is what the majority of ipod customers are interested in - it s a natural next step   said mr fogg. apple has traditionally done well in the market that the mac mini is aimed at  said mr fogg  who also expected many pc makers to release copycat devices in reaction.  his only misgivings were over how easy other consumers  other than ipod owners  would find using the machine. he said anyone wanting to use the mac mini with the peripherals from an old computer may find it odd to have something so small and sleek next to a hulking monitor.  they d be much more likely to pair a mac mini with a lcd or flat panel monitor which increases the upgrade cost   he said. those with flat screens and lcd monitors are likely to have bought them recently and not be in the market for a new machine.  there are also questions over whether the mac mini will work with very old peripherals  such as display  keyboard and mouse. the mac mini also fell short of being a media server that can be a video recorder as well as a store for all the digital music  movies and images people accumulate  said mr fogg.  the mac mini is not quite ready for that yet   he said.  it does not have the right connectors that fit a tv screen or enough storage.  said mr fogg:  it s very much a computer.  one dissenting opinion came from brian gammage  vice-president of research at analysts gartner. he said:  i don t think it changes the world.  although the mac mini was very cheap for an apple computer  it was still expensive compared to many pcs. also  he said  it appealed in categories that few consumers care about when buying a home computer.  the pc world is a pile-em-high  sell-em-cheap market   he said   and all of them are pretty interchangeable.   since the days when apple ruled the personal computing world its market share has been on a long  slow decline   he said.  every few years it does something to give its market share a kick then it starts to go back down again   said mr gammage. the release of the mac mini fit perfectly with this trend  he said.,1.4696035

1661,politics,drink remark  acts as diversion  the first minister s statement that it was okay to get drunk  once in a while  has diverted attention from the real issues  it has been claimed.  jack law  chief executive of alcohol focus scotland  said jack mcconnell s comment was  ill-advised . the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotland s binge drinking problems  mr law said. scotsman journalist hamish macdonell said he believed the bigger picture had been  obscured  by the remark. mr mcconnell was speaking on monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions.  the one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the scottish national party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were  a recognition that people will get drunk . mr macdonell  political editor of the scotsman  said:  i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister.  if you come out with something like this  saying that by all means get drunk  then you will be pilloried for it.  however  he added that  perhaps mr mcconnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage .  mr macdonell said:  i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking.  but that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. i understand why  but i think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured.  mr law  from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland  believed damage had been done to scotland s fight against binge drinking. he said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink. mr law added:  i think the remark was ill-advised - but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in scotland.   we don t want to preach to young people  but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically.  this diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness.  he said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk. mr macdonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were  off the mark   they were bound to  come back and bite him . he added:  here  mr mcconnell was talking in the highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the scottish executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters.  i think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark.   the scottish national party s holyrood leader nicola sturgeon wrote to mr mcconnell on tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his  ill-judged comment  and withdraw it immediately. in a furious response  the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context. he told ms sturgeon:  it is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that i  should encourage young people to get drunk .  that is completely untrue. perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position  undermine the convener of education at highland council and insult the intelligence of the young people i spoke with - all for the sake of a simple soundbite.,0.34880543

1513,tech,robotic pods take on car design a new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by japanese car giant toyota.  the company s vision for the single passenger in the 21st century involves the driver cruising by in a four-wheeled leaf-like device or strolling along encased in an egg-shaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet. both these prototypes will be demonstrated  along with other concept vehicles and helper robots  at the toyota stand at the expo 2005 in aichi  japan  in march 2005. the models are being positioned as so-called personal mobility devices  which have few limits. the open leaf-like  i-unit  vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year. built using environmentally friendly plant-based materials  the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes. the model allows the user to make tight on-the-spot turns  move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds. body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music.  also on display at the show will be the egg-shaped  i-foot . this is a two-legged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick.  standing at a height of well over seven feet (2.1 metres)  the unit can walk along at a speed of about 1.35km/h (0.83mph) and navigate staircases into the bargain. mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the bird-like legs that bend over backwards.  they are clearly what we call concept vehicles  innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production   said dr david gillingwater from the transport studies group at loughborough university.  they clearly have eye-catching appeal  which is in part the name of the game here  and are linked to the imac and ipod-type niche which apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years - new  different  hi-tech  image conscious products.  as always with these concept vehicles  it is difficult to see  who  they would appeal to and what their role would be in the  personal transport  marketplace.   the personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities. toyota s prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport. powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much us military research over the years and japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications. with an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population  care giving and the military  wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individual s particular mobility needs. while toyota s prototypes are geared towards mass transport  the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility.  experts  though  are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area.   those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance  now and certainly in the future  are the elderly and infirm people   dr gillingwater told the bbc news website.  you have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups.  design considerations also exist. dr erel avineri  of the centre for transport and society at the university of the west of england in bristol said:  the design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled.  for example  one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body  making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up.  it looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need. this and other human-factors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered   said dr avineri.  in general  introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades. elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation.  this may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle.  such single-person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport.  the concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions   said dr gillingwater.  what s their range  how user-friendly will they really be  what infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used.  overall i think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions.,-1.7293959
201,business,profits stall at china s lenovo profits at chinese computer firm lenovo have stood still amid slowing demand at home and stiffening competition.  the firm is in the international spotlight after last year signing a deal to buy the pc division of personal computer pioneer ibm. lenovo s profit for the three months to december was hk$327m (us$42m; £22m)  less than 1% up on the year before. chinese pc sales have risen by a fifth in each of the past two years  but are now growing more slowly. the company is still by far the biggest player in china  with more than a quarter of the market. but western firms such as dell and hewlett-packard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in china  and lenovo s sales were down 3.7% by revenue to hk$6.31bn.  if the $1.75bn agreement lenovo signed with ibm on 8 december goes through  it will mark the end of an era. ibm pioneered the desktop pc market in the early 1980s  although strategic mis-steps helped lose it its early dominance. in any case  margins in pc market are now wafer thin  and profits have been hard to come by for most vendors except direct-sales giant dell. but investors have been less than impressed with lenovo s move  designed to take it out of china and further onto the world stage. its shares are down 20% since the announcement two months ago  largely because of the unprofitability of the unit it is buying. there have been rumours that the deal could be in trouble because us government agencies fear it could offer china opportunities for industrial espionage. the reports of the possibility of an investigation into the risk sent lenovo s shares up 6% in late january.,-1.2780805

1429,business,bt offers equal access to rivals bt has moved to pre-empt a possible break-up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals.  the move comes after telecom regulator ofcom said in november that the firm must offer competitors  real equality of access to its phone lines . at the time  ofcom offered bt the choice of change or splitting into two. ofcom is carrying out a strategic review aimed at promoting greater competition in the uk telecom sector. bt s competitors have frequently accused it of misusing its status as the former telecoms monopoly and controller of access to many customers to favour its own retail arm.  this latest submission was delivered to the watchdog ahead of a deadline for the second phase of its review.   central to the proposals are plans by bt to offer operators lower wholesale prices  faster broadband services and transparent  highly-regulated access to bt s local network   the former monopoly said in a statement.  the united kingdom has the opportunity to create the most exciting and innovative telecoms market in the world   bt chief executive ben verwaayen said.  bt has a critical role to play  and today we are making a set of far-reaching proposals towards that framework   he said. bt wants lighter regulation in exchange for the changes  as well as the removal of the break-up threat.  the group is to set up a new access services division - with a separate board which would include independent members - to ensure equal access for rivals to the  local loop   the copper wires that run between telephone exchanges and households. the company also unveiled plans to cut the wholesale prices of its most popular broadband product by about 8% from april in areas of high customer demand.  it added that it plans to invest £10bn in the next five years to create a  21st century network . to meet the growing demand for greater bandwidth  bt said it would begin trials in april with a view to launching higher-speed services nationally from the autumn.  telecom analysts ovum welcomed the move  saying bt had  given a lot of ground .   the big question now is whether the industry  and particularly ofcom feels bt s proposals go far enough ...now the real negotiation begins   director of telecoms research tony lavender said. internet service provider (isp) plus.net also backed the proposals saying  we will be entirely happy if ofcom accepts them .  bt has been challenged to play fair and its plans will introduce a level playing field. the scenario now is how well people execute their business plans as a service provider   chief executive lee strafford said. chris panayis  managing director of isp freedom2surf said that it would make the situation clearer for business.  i think it s the first productive thing we ve had from bt   he said.  aol backed the price cuts but said regulation was still needed to ensure a level playing field.  this is a reminder to ofcom that as long as bt can change the dynamics of the whole broadband market at will  the process of opening up the uk s local telephone network to infrastructure investment and competition remains fragile   a spokesman said.  ofcom needs to return to regulation of the wholesale broadband service [ipstream] and provide more robust rules for local loop unbundling if consumers are to see the benefits of increased competition and infrastructure investment.  more than 100 telecom firms  consumer groups and other interested parties are expected to make submissions to the regulator during this consultation phase. ofcom is expected to spend the next few weeks examining the proposals before making an announcement within the next few months.,-1.1349845
497,business,putin backs state grab for yukos russia s president has defended the purchase of yukos  key production unit by state-owned oil firm rosneft  saying it followed free market principles.  vladimir putin said it was quite within the rights of a state-owned company to ensure its interests were met. rosneft bought 100% of baikal finance group  in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of russia s booming oil industry. rosneft will now control about 16% of russia s total crude oil output. yukos share jumped in moscow  climbing as much as 50% before being suspended.  rosneft is already in the process of merging with gazprom  the world s biggest gas company  a move that will see gazprom return to majority state-ownership.  baikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant yukos s main production division at a forced auction on sunday.  everything was done by market methods   mr putin said at his year-end press conference in moscow. shedding some light on the kremlin s motivation  mr putin referred to a period of so-called  cowboy capitalism  that followed the collapse of the soviet union.  he said privatisations carried out in the early 1990s had involved trickery  including law breaking  by people seeking to acquire valuable state property.  now the state  using market methods  is safeguarding its interests. i think this is quite normal   the russian president said. a rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a  balanced  national energy corporation.   the latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed yukos  one of russia s biggest companies to the brink of collapse. the russian government put yukos s yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a $27bn (£14bn) bill for back taxes and fines.  analysts say that yukos s legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the us are probably what caused this week s cloak-and-dagger dealings. gazprom  the company originally tipped to buy yuganskneftegas  was banned from taking part in the auction by a us court injunction. by selling the yukos unit to little-known baikal and then to rosneft  russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines  analysts said.  you cannot sue the russian government   said eric kraus  a strategist at moscow s sovlink securities.  the russian government has sovereign immunity.   the government is renationalising yuganskneftegas.   even so  analysts reckon that the saga still has a long way to go. the rosneft announcement came just hours after yukos accused gazprom of illegally taking part in sunday s auction. it has said it will be seeking damages of $20bn. the claim was made at the latest hearing in the us bankruptcy court in houston  texas  where yukos  had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. if found in contempt of the us court order blocking the auction  gazprom could face having foreign assets seized. yukos  lawyers had also been expected to try to have baikal s assets frozen. lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because yukos - with an office in houston - had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of us law which has worldwide jurisdiction. further muddying the waters is a merger between rosneft and gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned.,1.6140718

580,tech,napster offers rented music to go music downloading  for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services  can be a costly business.  the cost of paying even as little as 70p per track can add up  particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs. paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient  and ultimately cheaper way of owning music.   music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services   said paul myers  chief executive of wippit  a uk-based music download service. while itunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to ipod owners  others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service - dubbed napster to go in the uk in the next few months. the service can be used on players that support microsoft windows latest digital rights management technology known as janus. this includes players made by samsung  rio and creative.  currently on offer in beta-version in the us  the service costs $15 per month for unlimited downloads. the technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service. users need to update their license on a monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play.  this has outraged some digital music lovers  especially as napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the pc. napster claims the higher price is a result of record labels charging more for the to-go service and says it also offers  greater value  for customers. mr myers is not convinced a rental model will work for consumers.  we ve been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want. format interoperability  excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose   he said.  who wants to download a track that won t play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an ipod or the latest mobile phone   wippit offers a download subscription service for £4.99 per month or £50 per year. it has a catalogue of around 60 000 songs.,-1.8372507

2111,tech,warning over windows word files writing a microsoft word document can be a dangerous business  according to document security firm workshare.  up to 75% of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed  a survey by the firm revealed. to make matters worse 90% of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking. the report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding.  sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms  competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers  said andrew pearson  european boss of workshare which commissioned the research.  the efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too   he said. the problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using microsoft word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes. as documents get passed around  worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents. poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits. microsoft  however  does provide an add-on tool for windows pcs that fixes the problem.  the remove hidden data add-in is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your microsoft office application   says the instructions on microsoft s website. microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any word document. a tool for apple machines running word is not available. workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that  on average  31% of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three-quarters fell in to the high risk category. often  said mr pearson  this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared.  however  the way that windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved. few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so-called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed. the discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if  for instance  those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated. the research revealed that a document s metadata could be substantial as  on average  only 40% of contributors  changes to a document make it to the final draft. problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite  said mr pearson.,-0.3121667

816,business,india unveils anti-poverty budget india is to boost spending on primary schools and health in a budget flagged as a boost for the ordinary citizen.  india s defence budget has also been raised 7.8% to 830bn rupees ($19bn). the priority for finance minister palaniappan chidambaram is to fight poverty and keep the government s communist allies onside. but his options are limited by a new law which makes him cut the budget deficit  which he said would be 4.5% of gdp in the year to march 2005. the country s overall deficit is thought to be more than 10%  if the spending of india s 35 states and territories is included. under the fiscal responsibility law  mr chidambaram has to trim the deficit by 0.3 percentage points each year  a target he says he has now met for the current year.  but the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005-6 target for the deficit will be 4.3%  mr chidambaram said - falling short of the new law s requirement.  i was left with no option but to press the pause button vis a vis the act   he said. the following year  though  would have to be back on track  he warned.   i may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means   he said. the coming year s reduction has meant bringing more of the businesses in india s burgeoning services sector into the tax system and restructuring the personal tax system  although there are numerous corporate tax and duty reductions built into the budget.  presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament  mr chidambaram said the indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in. he said india s economy grew 6.9% in 2004. in his budget mr chidambaram has:  - increased spending on primary education to 71.56bn rupees ($1.6bn)   - increased spending on health to 102.8bn rupees ($2.35bn)   - announced that 80bn rupees ($1.8bn) will be spent on building rural infrastructure   - pledged 102.16bn rupees ($2.3bn) for tsunami victims   - increased flow of funds to agriculture by 30%   - announced a package for the sugar industry  in addition  up to 100bn rupees ($2.3bn) to be spent on infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the country s foreign exchange reserves  keeping budgeted spending under control.  given the resilience of the indian economy... it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty   mr chidambaram said.  the whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty.  the new indian government  led by the congress party  was voted into power last may after it pledged to introduce economic reforms with a  human face .  the finance minister says he is committed to continue reforming india s tax system while expanding the tax base. as part of his reforms he has announced:  - duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials   - expanded service tax net   - raised the income-tax threshold to 100 000 rupees ($2 300)   - reduced income tax for those earning less than 250 000 rupees ($5 700) to 20%   - reduced corporate tax rates to 30%  an annual economic survey released on friday said india needed to ease limit restriction on foreign investment  reform labour laws and cut duties apart from widening the tax base for long-term economic growth. but mr chidambaram is under pressure from the communist parties to focus on increasing social spending. the communists are also hostile to measures seeking to increase foreign investment and allow companies to hire and fire employees at will. in recent months  they have expressed their displeasure at the government s economic reform plans including increasing foreign direct investment in telecommunication and aviation. in his last budget  mr chidambaram had pledged billions of dollars for improving education and health services for the poor as well as special assistance for farmers.,-1.2720532

2041,tech,virus poses as christmas e-mail security firms are warning about a windows virus disguising itself as an electronic christmas card.  the zafi.d virus translates the christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. anti-virus firm sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the zafi virus.  like many other windows viruses  zafi-d plunders microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. to be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. the attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces.  the virus  subject line says  merry christmas  and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. the message in the body of the e-mail reads:  happy holidays  and this too is translated. on infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the pc to hand over control to the writer of the virus. the virus is thought to have spread most widely in south america  italy  spain  bulgaria and hungary. the original zafi virus appeared in april this year.  we have seen these hoaxes for several christmases already  and personally i prefer traditional pen and paper cards  and we recommend this to all our clients too   said mikko hypponen  who heads f-secure s anti-virus team.,3.9502082

1438,tech,microsoft debuts security tools microsoft is releasing tools that clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware.  the virus-fighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to microsoft releasing dedicated anti-virus software. also being released is a software utility that will help users find and remove any spyware on their home computer. although initially free it is thought that soon microsoft will be charging users for the anti-spyware tool.  the anti-spyware tool is available now and the anti-virus utility is expected to be available later this month. microsoft s windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited. it has proved such a tempting target that there are now thought to be more than 100 000 viruses and other malicious programs in existence. latest research suggests that new variants of viruses are being cranked out at a rate of up to 200 per week. spyware is surreptitious software that sneaks on to home computers  often without users  knowledge. in its most benign form it just bombards users with pop-up adverts or hijacks web browser settings. the most malicious forms steal confidential information or log every keystroke that users make. surveys have shown that most pcs are infested with spyware. research by technology firms earthlink and webroot revealed that 90% of windows machine have the malicious software on board and  on average  each one harbours 28 separate spyware programs. before now microsoft has left the market for pc security software to specialist firms such as symantec  mcafee  trend micro and many others. it said that its virus cleaning program would not stop machines being infected nor remove the need for other anti-virus programs. on spyware freely available programs such as ad-aware and spybot have become widely used by people keen to keep the latest variants at bay. microsoft s two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years. in 2003 it bought romanian firm gecad software to get hold of its anti-virus technology. in december 2004 it bought new york-based anti-spyware firm giant company software. last year microsoft also released the sp2 upgrade for windows xp that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their anti-virus and firewall programs.,3.1493752

1787,tech,fast lifts rise into record books two high-speed lifts at the world s tallest building have been officially recognised as the planet s fastest.  the lifts take only 30 seconds to whisk passengers to the top of the 508m tall tfc 101 tower in taipei  taiwan. the guinness book of records has declared the 17m per second speed of the two lifts the swiftest on earth. the lifts also have a pressure control system to stop passengers  ears popping as they ascend and descend at high speed.  in total  the tfc tower has 61 lifts  34 of them double-deckers  and 50 escalators to shuttle people around its 106 floors. the tfc 101 tower is due to be officially opened on 31 december.  the super-fast lifts can speed up to 24 passengers to the tip of the tower in about 30 seconds  while ascending their 382m track. the 17m/s top speed of the lifts translates to about 38mph (61km/h). curiously the lifts take longer to descend and spend almost a whole minute returning to ground level from the top of the tfc tower. the key new technologies applied in the world s fastest elevators include:    - a pressure control system  which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers  preventing  ear popping    - an active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations   - streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft      the certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative guinness world records is a great honour for us   said masayuki shimono  president of manufacturer toshiba elevator and building systems which installed the lifts. the first record for the world s fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the guinness book of records in 1955.  as such  it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the 50 years since that first edition  when the record was 426m per minute  or 25.6 km/h  less than half the speed of the new record   said hein le roux  specialist researcher at the guinness world records. taipei s tfc 101 tower is more than 50m taller than the petronas towers in kuala lumpur  malaysia - formerly the world s tallest skyscraper.,-5.0049114
132,sport,wales get williams fitness boost wales are hopeful that openside flanker martyn williams could be fit for saturday s rbs 6 nations championship opener against england in cardiff.  williams was expected to miss the match with a disc problem in his neck  but has been making a speedy recovery.  he will have tests in the next 48 hours and we are pretty optimistic he is getting there   wales  team physiotherapist mark davies said.  it has been frustrating but he is on the mend  he has made good progress.  last week williams  along with fellow flanker colin charvis - who is unlikely to play for at least a month while he recovers from a foot injury - was all but ruled out of the millennium stadium clash. with williams initially thought to be struggling  the signs pointed towards wales coach mike ruddock handing a first cap to former wales under-21 skipper richie pugh.  cardiff blues flanker williams  29  offers considerable experience and if he is declared fit then ruddock might be tempted to include him in the back row. charvis will be reviewed by the wales medical staff next monday  but davies admitted that there was only an  outside chance  of him being fit to face france in wales  third championship game on 26 february. wales  other injury concern is pugh s fellow neath-swansea ospreys player sonny parker  as the centre has a trapped nerve in his neck.  sonny s injury is still an issue   davies said.  it is still painful and irritable. we will run the rule of thumb over him in the next couple of days.  ruddock will name his starting line-up for the england game at 1830 gmt on tuesday evening  as wales target their first victory in cardiff over the world champions since 1993.,1.87888
140,business,disaster claims  less than $10bn  insurers have sought to calm fears that they face huge losses after an earthquake and giant waves killed at least 38 000 people in southern asia.  munich re and swiss re  the world s two biggest reinsurers  have said exposure will be less than for other disasters. rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries  and many of those affected will not have insurance  analysts said. swiss re has said total claims are likely to be less than $10bn (£5.17bn). swiss re believes that the cost would be substantial but that it is unlikely to be in double-digit billions  the financial times reported. munich re  the world s largest reinsurance company  said that its exposure is less than 100m euros (£70m; $136m).  at least 10 countries have been affected  with sri lanka  indonesia  india and thailand among the worst hit. the region s resorts and western tourists are expected to be among the main claimants.  lloyds of london told the financial times it expected its exposure to be limited to  holiday resorts  personal accident  travel insurance and marine risks . a spokeswoman for hanover re  europe s fifth-largest reinsurance firm  estimated tsunami-related damage claims would be in the low double-digit millions of euros. the company has paid out about 300 million euros (£281m; $400m) to cover damage caused recently by four major hurricanes in the us.  but insurers have not had long to assess the economic impact of the damage and reports of more casualties and destruction are still coming through.   so many things are unclear  it is just too early to tell   said serge troeber  deputy head of swiss re s natural disasters department.  you need very complicated processes to estimate damages. unlike the hurricanes  you can t just run a model.  he anticipated that his own company s total claims would be less then those from the hurricanes  which the company put at $640m. allianz  a leading german insurer  said it did not know yet what its exposure would be. however  it said the tidal waves were unlikely to have a  significant  impact on its business. zurich financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster.  the impact on us insurance companies is not expected to be heavy  analysts said.  most us insurers have relatively little exposure to asia and those that do  pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds. insured damage could be a fraction of the  billions of dollars worth of destruction in sri lanka  india  thailand  indonesia  the maldive islands and malaysia   said prudential equity group insurance analyst jay gelb.  us insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure. it s more likely the bermuda-based reinsurance [companies] might have some exposure   said paul newsome  an insurance analyst at ag edwards & co.  many of the affected countries  such as indonesia  sri lanka or the maldives  do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters  said a us-based insurance expert. early estimates from the world bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including sri lanka  india  indonesia and thailand  at about $5bn (£2.6bn)  similar to the cash offered to central america after hurricane mitch.  mitch killed about 10 000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998. but the cost of the tsunamis on the individuals involved is incalculable.  we cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the nameless fishermen and fishing villages ... that have just been wiped out. hundreds of thousands of livelihoods have gone   said jan egeland  head of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. tourists cutting short their holidays in affected areas may suffer a financial impact too. the association of british insurers warned that travel insurance does not normally cover cutting short a holiday. it said loss of possessions will usually be covered  but the association stressed the importance of checking the wording of travel policies.,1.8885374
464,business,metlife buys up citigroup insurer us banking giant citigroup has sold its travelers life & annuity insurance arm to metlife for $11.5bn (£6.1bn).  the sale is a further move by citigroup away from its 1990s strategy of offering every financial service - insurance  broking and banking. profit growth in the insurance market has not matched expansion at citigroup s other businesses. for metlife  the us s leading insurance company  the purchase gives it access to a much larger distribution network.  robert benmosche  metlife s chairman and chief executive  said that it was a  great opportunity for the brand of metlife to be distributed through citigroup . under the agreement  metlife will be able to sell its products through citigroup over the next 10 years. the deal includes smith barney retail brokerages and citibank branches. the company will pay between $1bn and $3bn in metlife stock with the rest being made up of cash. travelers had sales of $5.2bn in 2004 and made a profit of $901m. it has total net assets of $96bn.  this deal employs some of metlife s excess capital in a potentially higher-return business and gives it more distribution   said stuart quint  an analyst at gartmore.,1.6393666
245,sport,o connell rejects lions rumours ireland and munster lock paul o connell has dismissed media reports linking him to the captaincy of the lions tour to new zealand this summer.  o connell is rumoured to be among the front-runners for the job  but says he is totally focused on sunday s six nations crunch clash with england.  i honestly don t think about these reports   he told bbc sport.  the lions thing is all speculation and newspaper talk  nothing more. i just ignore it and get on with my job.  he added:  the only thing that annoys me after reading some reports is what the opposition locks think.  i can just imagine them saying  i m going to show this guy what s what about second row play . that s the one thing that makes me cringe.  o connell  who made a try-scoring international debut against wales two years ago  is enjoying his meteoric rise into rugby s shop window - but refuses to be drawn on the lions.   i have spoken to sir clive woodward a few times  but not for very long  certainly nothing about summer holidays   he joked. he also said he remains wary of wounded england s abilities coming into sunday s game after two straight defeats  dismissing predictions of a certain irish victory.  it s very dangerous to think that. this england team has so much experience and skill. you do not become a bad team overnight.  they have two world class game-breakers in josh lewsey and jason robinson  while charlie hodgson is just ready to click into place.  he insisted ireland will not make the mistake of being over-confident.  that s not going to happen in our squad. no ireland team lining up to play england will ever fall into that trap   he said.  every time we play england we know what a big task it is. look at what they did to us two years ago. i remember that game all too well  and it was not a good feeling.  i came on as a replacement and we were losing 13-6  and ended up getting hammered 42-6  so i know what can happen when england come to dublin.  they could so easily have been coming to dublin with two wins and staring a grand slam in the face as well.,0.3860488

134,business,dollar hovers around record lows the us dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on friday as concern grows about the size of the us budget deficit.  analysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the us economy. the bush administration s apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern. however  trading has been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. this has amplified reactions to news  analysts said  adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in january.  the dollar was trading at $1.3652 versus the euro on friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $1.3667 on thursday. one dollar bought 102.55 yen.  disappointing business figures from chicago triggered the us currency s weakness on thursday. the national association of purchasing management-chicago said its manufacturing index dropped to 61.2  a bigger fall than expected.  there are no dollar buyers now  especially after the chicago data yesterday   said abn amro s paul mackel. at the same time  german chancellor gerhard schroeder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. mr berlusconi said the euro s strength was  absolutely worrying  for italian exports. mr schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances. investors will now look towards february s meeting of finance ministers from the g7 industrialised nations in london for clues as to whether central banks will combine forces to stem the dollar s decline.,1.0965075
227,sport,all black magic: new zealand rugby playing colours:  all black  the haka and more!  the all blacks  charles john munro discovered rugby at london s christ college  and on his return to nelson he staged new zealand s first game. nelson town met nelson college on 14 may  1870  the town triumphing by two goals to nil  instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the country s sporting passions. the game appealed to the kiwi psyche and quickly spread  the native maoris finding a particular empathy with the sport s warrior ethos. in 1888 a british team led by ae stoddart toured new zealand and australia  and soon after a maori named joe warbrick and an english ex-pat called thomas eyton decided to gather a combined new zealand team.  twenty-two maori and four  pakiha  formed the  new zealand native team   who played a total of 107 matches in new zealand  australia and the uk. the integration of white and maori was a reflecion of enlightened new zealand rugby and society  even if the british press were somewhat mystified by the pre-match tradition of the maori war dance  the haka! the other great symbol of new zealand rugby  the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast  was proposed by tom ellison at the first annual meeting of the new zealand rugby football union in 1893. new zealand played their first international against australia in 1903  the kiwis triumphing 22-3 in sydney  and the following year an official british touring team came to new zealand for the first time. the tourists had gone through australia undefeated but their captain  david revell bedell-sivright  created animosity in new zealand with his patronising attitude. the kiwis shocked the rugby world with a 9-3 triumph in wellington  sparking great celebrations across the country  but bedell-sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the uk.  their opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official new zealand tour to europe. the tourists won their early games with a quick-thinking  inventive approach  but press criticism began to grow over their 2-3-2 scrum formation that left a  roving  forward free to disrupt opposition attacks. the tactic was effective  two late tries seeing the kiwis to a 12-7 win over scotland  before ireland were despatched 15-0 in dublin. a huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka - but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a 15-0 hammering of england. new zealand headed to wales to meet a country in the midst of its first  golden age   and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides. an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed a 3-0 win in a hard-fought encounter at cardiff arms park  but post-match talk was dominated by a bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas. dallas said that deans was tackled short  but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try - on his death-bed three years later he exclaimed:  i did score that try in cardiff.   four of the 1905 all blacks went over to the newly formed  all golds  rugby league side soon after the tour  but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglo-welsh touring team in 1908. the first south africa tour of new zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three-test series  starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the all blacks  inclusion of maori players. the awesome 1924-5 all black tourists became known as  the invincibles  after winning all 30 of their games in france  britain and ireland  including a crushing 19-0 victory over wales at st helen s. despite their success  the all blacks  2-3-2 scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times  and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in 1928. employing the modern 3-4-1 scrum line-up against the new zealand  rover  system for the first time  south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn two-all. the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the 1930 lions tour (a series won 3-1 by new zealand)  the lions manager describing the tactic as  cheating   prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum.  the all blacks  1935 european tour started inauspiciously with an 11-3 loss to a swansea side inspired by teenage  schoolboy half-backs hayden tanner and willie davies. a thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales 13-12  although the winning try from geoffrey rees-jones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the build-up. new zealand s next visit to wales in 1953 proved difficult as they lost 8-3 to cardiff and drew 6-6 at swansea. the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park  but the teams were locked at 8-8 when a clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for a famous  match-winning try. the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations  before a 19-5 success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller. new zealand built from that tour  and by the time they returned in 1963-4 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world.  that made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely 3-0 win over the tourists at rodney parade. wilson whinneray s side rallied to beat wales 6-0  their first win at the arms park in four attempts  and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour  but when they returned home the first question put to them was:  what happened in newport   the only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with east wales  as they beat the full wales team 13-6 in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time. that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in 1969  the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team.  a ferocious game at the arms park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the all blacks  a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james-inspired lions of 1971.  james guided llanelli to a famous 9-3 win over the tourists at stradey park  though  and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks 23-11 in cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played. new zealand defeated a wales xv 12-3 at the arms park in a non-cap game in 1974  but it was the 1978 game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries.  wales were leading 12-10 with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from a line-out. television pictures clearly showed that he dived  but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty  duly converted by brian mckechnie for a 13-12 win. since that infamous game  the competition has largely left wales v new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game. a crushing 23-3 win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby union s 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come. the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside 49-6 in brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural world cup. the kiwis went on to claim the cup  and would inflict further misery on wales on their ill-fated 1988 tour of new zealand.  a young  talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners  but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them 52-3 and 54-9. after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games  wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game  but as his views were ignored he - along with a generation of wales  best players - chose to head north to rugby league.  a 34-9 win in cardiff followed for new zealand in 1989  and at the 1995 world cup wales  big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg. a crushing 42-7 kiwi triumph in wembley followed in 1997  and as wales  misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen. there was a temporary resurgence in the welsh game  but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiff s new millennium stadium in 2002 they left with a 43-17 victory.  a bruising 55-3 defeat followed for wales in hamilton in 2003 as hansen built towards the world cup  but in australia it was a remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope. wales were given no chance going into the game  but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead 37-33 early in the second half. new zealand rallied to a 53-37 win  but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future. they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen  coming to europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season. an encouraging display against south africa has inspired a confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years. they have a chance  but clearly history is not on their side.,-5.498085

1955,sport,hewitt survives nalbandian epic home favourite lleyton hewitt came through a dramatic five-set battle with argentine david nalbandian to reach the australian open semi-finals.  hewitt looked to be cruising to victory after racing into a two-set lead. but nalbandian broke his serve three times in both of the next two sets to set up a nailbiting decider. hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the 17th game and served out to win 6-3 6-2 1-6 3-6 10-8 and set up a meeting with andy roddick. the winner of that match will face either roger federer or marat safin in the final. ninth seed nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match  and there was no indication he would do so as hewitt dominated the first two sets.  the argentine had stoked up the temperature ahead of the match by saying hewitt s exuberant on-court celebrations were  not very good for the sport . and he had words with hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs. the balance of power changed completely in the third set as hewitt allowed his level to dip  and he double-faulted twice as nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set. but the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat. he then produced a love service game to finish off the match in four hours and five minutes.  i just kept hanging in there. it was always tough serving second in the fifth set   said hewitt  who had never reached the last four at his home grand slam.  i told myself to give everything and in the end it paid off once again.  it s a long way from holding that trophy up there but i m hanging in there.  only four guys left that can win and we re the top four in the world. it s set up for a pretty good showdown in the semis and finals.,0.9639616
181,tech,blogger grounded by her airline a us airline attendant is fighting for her job after she was suspended over postings on her blog  or online diary.  queen of the sky  otherwise known as ellen simonetti  evolved into an anonymous semi-fictional account of life in the sky. but after she posted pictures of herself in uniform  delta airlines suspended her indefinitely without pay. ms simonetti was told her suspension was a result of  inappropriate  images. delta airlines declined to comment.   i was really shocked  i had no warning   ms simonetti told bbc news online.  i never thought i would get in trouble because of the blog. i thought if they had a problem  someone would have said something before taking action.  the issue has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest  employment law and free speech on personal websites. ms simonetti was suspended on 25 september pending an investigation and has since lodged a complaint with the us equal employment opportunity commission (eeoc). a spokesperson for delta airlines told bbc news online:  all i can tell you is we do not discuss internal employee issues with the media.  she added she could not say whether a similar situation over personal websites had occurred in the past.  ms simonetti started her personal blog in january to help her get over her mother s death. she had ensured she made no mention of which airline she worked for  and created fictional names for cities and companies. the airline s name was changed to anonymous airline and the city in which she was based was called quirksville. a large part of the blog contained fictional stories because queen of the sky developed over the months as a character in her own right  according to ms simonetti.  the images were taken from a digital camera she had inherited from her mother.  we often take pictures on flight or on layovers. i just though why not include them on my blog for fun.  i never meant it as something to harm my company and don t understand how they think it did harm them   ms simonetti said. she has also claimed that pictures of male delta airline employees in uniform are freely available on the web. of the 10 or so images on the site  only one showed ms simonetti s flight  wings .  they did not tell me which pictures they had a problem with. i am just assuming it was the one of me posing on seats where my skirt rode up   she said. the images were removed as soon as she learned she had been suspended. as far as ms simonetti knows  there is no company anti-blogging policy. there is guidance which suggests the company uniform cannot be used without approval from management  but use in personal pictures on websites is unclear.  jeffrey matsuura  director of the law and technology programme at the university of dayton  said personal websites can be hazardous for both employers and their employees.  there are many examples of employees who have presented some kind of material online that have gotten them in trouble with employers   he said. it was crucial that any policy about what was and what was not acceptable was expressed clearly  was reasonable  and enforced fairly in company policy.  you have to remember that as an employee  you don t have total free speech anymore   he said. mr matsuura added that some companies actively encouraged employees to blog.  one of the areas where it does become a problem is that they encourage this when it suits them  but they may not be particularly clear when they [employees] do cross the line.  he speculated that delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images of ms simonetti in uniform were posted.  whether or not that is successful will depend on what exactly is prohibited  and whether you can reasonably say this content now crosses that line   he said. ms simonetti said her suspension has caused two of her friends to discontinue their blogs. one of them was asked to stop blogging by his company before any action was taken.  if they had asked me just take down the blog  i would have done it  but that was not been given to me as an option   she said.  this blogging thing is obviously a new problem for employers and they need to get a policy about it. if i had known it would cost me my job  i would not have done that.,-2.5341663
1609,sport,a year to remember for irish there used to be one subliminal moment during a year in irish rugby that stood out more than most.  well  at least there used to one. now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction  and sorrow. it has been quite a year for the irish  and not just with eddie o sullivan s triple crown winning international outfit either. right down through the ranks irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game. but most of the kudos will go to o sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for 29 years  but also finished their autumn campaign with a 100% record. for the second year in succession they also finished in the runners-up spot in the rbs six nations. but in the three games in november which included a victory over tri-nations champions and grand slam chasing south africa  ireland finsihed the year on a high. the 18-12 victory at lansdowne road was only their second victory over the boks after the initial success back in 1965. that success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in blomefontein and cape town in the summer. those two reverses and the 35-17 flop against france  were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent 12 months. but the big one  of course  was the 19-13 defeat of world cup champions england on their precious twickenham turf. the winning try was conceived in o sullivan s mind  perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey. for me  the try of the championship. o sullivan s career is now in vertical take-off mode. it is no wonder that sir clive woodward has elevated the galway-based coach to head the lions test side. not only that  but a fair majority of the present ireland side will be wearing red next june in new zealand.  there can be no doubt that ireland s representation will be the biggest ever  albeit in a proposed 44-man squad. in brian o driscoll and paul o connell  ireland have now the two front-runners for the captaincy. gordon d arcy  whose career began as a teenager back in 1999  finally arrived when he was named the six nations player of the tournament. but it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to ireland  the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well. the under-21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by a powerful all black side in the decider. the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners-up to england in the six nations under-21 tournament. on the provincial front  leinster  for second year in succession  blew it when the heineken cup looked a good wager. while ulster finished runners-up in their very tight group for the second season in succession  it was munster again flying the flag for the irish. looking to reach their third final  they went down 37-32 to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road. how wasps recovered from that energy-sapping duel  and then go onto to defeat toulouse in the final was anybody s guess. ulster  meanwhile  just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game.  ulster  however  took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall. the once famous ravenhill fortress was breached four times as ulster only manged five wins from their first 12 outings in the celtic league. leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into 2005  but whether they can take that final step under declan kidney is another thing. on the down side  irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies. teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under-19 world cup game in durban. that happened only 10 days after he led royal armagh to their first ulster schools  cup success since 1977. the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in a car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity a larger than life character  doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in 1985  the last time that goal had been achieved before this season. ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well-known londonderry ym player jim huey  coleraine s jonathan hutchinson  and belfast harlequins lock johnny poole. they all passed away long before the full-time whistle.,1.5315442
2118,politics,blair  pressing us on climate  tony blair is pressing the us to cut greenhouse gases despite its unwillingness to sign the kyoto protocol  downing street has indicated.  officials have confirmed climate change was discussed when influential senator john mccain recently visited mr blair. climate change was an issue the prime minister  wanted to progress  during the uk s presidency of the g8 and eu in 2005  said a spokesman. but he played down reports mr blair was considering a new us-friendly treaty.  according to the times  the uk leader wants to end us isolation with a  kyoto-lite  agreement on the scale and nature of the threat from climate change. he is said to have discussed the idea with mr mccain during his time at number 10. the prime minister is said to believe the united states  refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on emissions is undermining other countries  resolve to cut carbon dioxide production. so far the us has refused to sign up to the kyoto treaty - which aims to cut emissions - branding it politically motivated and not based on science. president bush s advisers have repeatedly denied global warming is taking place.  europe  which disputes the claim  has also signalled it wants to press ahead with talks about longer term climate change action in a way which involves both the united states and developing countries. mr blair s reported treaty would also establish an international programme to develop technology needed for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions  says the times. but there is still apparently  little prospect  of america agreeing to cut emissions  which could further provoke environmental campaigners already angry at the lack of progress. mr blair was left blushing on wednesday when it emerged his manifesto target of a 20% cut to the 1990 greenhouse gas level by 2010 was set to be missed.,1.1354213

342,tech,web photo storage market hots up an increasing number of firms are offering web storage for people with digital photo collections.  digital cameras were the hot gadget of christmas 2004 and worldwide sales of the cameras totalled $24bn last year. many people s hard drives are bulging with photos and services which allow them to store and share their pictures online are becoming popular. search firms such as google are also offering more complex tools for managing personal photo libraries. photo giants such as kodak offer website storage which manages photo collections  lets users edit pictures online and provides print-ordering services. some services  such as kodak s ofoto and snapfish  offer unlimited storage space but they do require users to buy some prints online. other sites  such as pixagogo  charge a monthly fee. marcus hawkins  editor of digital camera magazine  said:  as file sizes of pictures increase  storage becomes a problem.  people are using their hard drives  backing up on cd and dvd and now they are using online storage solutions.   they are a place to store pictures  to share their pictures with families and friends and they can print out their photos.   while many of the services are aimed at the amateur and casual digital photographer  other websites are geared up for enthusiasts who want to share tips and information. photosig is an online community of photographers who can critique each other s work. on tuesday  google released free software for organising and finding digital photos stored on a computer s hard drive. the tool  called picasa  automatically detects photos as they are added to a pc - whether sent via e-mail or transferred from a digital camera.  the software includes tools for restoring colour and removing red eye  as well as sharpening images. photos can then be uploaded to sites such as ofoto. many people use the sites to edit and improve their favourite photographs before ordering prints. mr hawkins added:  the growth area is that you can order your prints online. friends and family can also access pictures you want them to see and they can print them out too.  rather than just a place to dump your pictures  it s about sharing them.   the vast majority of pictures remain on a pc s hard drive  which is why search tools  such as those offered by google  become increasingly important. but some historians and archivists are concerned that the need for perfect pictures will mean that those poor quality prints which offered a tantilising glimpse of the past may disappear forever.  it s one thing taking pictures  it s another finding them   said mr hawkins.  but this is the same problem that has always existed - how many of us have photos in wallets tucked away somewhere,0.106191635

175,business,chinese exports rise 25% in 2004 exports from china leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth.  the spurt put china s trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high. it may also increase pressure on china to relax the peg joining its currency  the yuan  with the weakening dollar. the figures released by the ministry of commerce come as china s tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row. state administration of taxation head xie xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; £165bn).  according to the ministry of commerce  china s exports totalled $63.8bn in december  taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. with imports rising a similar amount  the deficit rose to $43.4bn. the increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004  according to mr xie. china s exporting success has made the trade deficit of the united states soar even further and made trade with china a sensitive political issue in washington. the peg keeping the yuan around 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by us lawmakers for job losses at home. a us report issued on tuesday on behalf of a congressionally-mandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and 2003. the pace accelerated in the final three years of the period  said the report for the us-china economic and security review commission  moving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors. the us s overall trade deficit with china was $124bn in 2003  and is expected to rise to about $150bn for 2004.,-1.0265365

761,entertainment,oscars steer clear of controversy the oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer  less contentious cinema.  if best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches  two of the front-runners would have had to be michael moore s bush-baiting documentary fahrenheit 9/11 and mel gibson s the passion of the christ. both films polarised opinion but had critics talking  and the public turning up to see them - fahrenheit 9/11 breaking us box office records for a documentary  and the passion of the christ making more than us$370m (£196m) in the us alone. but this year s academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies  with the passion of the christ - a film accused of being anti-semitic - receiving nominations only in the  minor  categories of cinematography  makeup and musical score.  fahrenheit 9/11 has also been overlooked  despite winning the palme d or at the cannes international film festival in 2004.  moore s caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors  decision to enter it in the best picture category  rather than best documentary  says tim dams  the news editor of trade magazine screen international. but he also believes the strong political viewpoint of moore s film does not sit well with the academy.  if you look at past oscar winners and nominees  the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative  epic-style pictures. fahrenheit 9/11 didn t really fit in to that category.  they tend to go for films like titanic  gladiator  and the lord of the rings  films with scale that often aren t too contentious   he said. while he said the oscar voting panel were not  snubbing  moore s film  he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category.  i think it s more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub   he said.  the problem with mel gibson s film  he believed  was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in aramaic  an ancient middle eastern language.   hollywood doesn t tend to like foreign-language films - no-one s ever tried doing a film in a dead language   he said. but aside from these two films  some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. the german film the downfall  a biopic tracing the final days of nazi leader adolf hitler in his berlin bunker  has been recognised in the best foreign film category. the film has caused some controversy in showing hitler as a fallible but human man  rather than a semi-mythical  historical monster. but mr dams said:  it s not an inflammatory film. it has done very well in germany  and it s a film that portrays hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster.  another  contentious  film  mr dams said  has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm.  independent film-maker morgan spurlock may have forced fast-food giant mcdonalds to withdraw its  super size  portions in the us after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but mcdonalds meals - and filmed his progress.  the film has been a hit around the world. mr dams said:  it s a political film  but it s quite fun and punky and well-paced.  morgan spurlock is a really likeable guy. it s a very accessible film  and it doesn t beat you over the head with its views.  while in fahrenheit 9/11 there are moments of comedy  i think the way that super size me is put together - the fact it s a very likeable film - means it s won through on charm.  dam s pick at this year s oscars  the aviator  martin scorsese s biopic of aviation pioneer and hollywood player howard hughes. tinseltown  it seems  likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own.,-2.471599

444,business,peugeot deal boosts mitsubishi struggling japanese car maker mitsubishi motors has struck a deal to supply french car maker peugeot with 30 000 sports utility vehicles (suv).  the two firms signed a memorandum of understanding  and say they expect to seal a final agreement by spring 2005. the alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making mitsubishi  after several profit warnings and poor sales. the suvs will be built in japan using peugeot s diesel engines and sold mainly in the european market. falling sales have left mitsubishi motors with underused capacity  and the production deal with peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.  in january  mitsubishi motors issued its third profits warning in nine months  and cut its sales forecasts for the year to march 2005. its sales have slid 41% in the past year  catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. as a result  the japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. last month it said it was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; £2.77bn) in fresh financial backing  half of it from other companies in the mitsubishi group. us-german carmaker daimlerchrylser  a 30% shareholder in mitsubishi motors  decided in april 2004 not to pump in any more money. the deal with peugeot was celebrated by mitsubishi s newly-appointed chief executive takashi nishioka  who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm s troubles. mitsubishi motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to march 2005. last month  it signed a production agreement with japanese rival nissan motor to supply it with 36 000 small cars for sale in japan. it has been making cars for nissan since 2003.,3.0598452

378,tech,parents face video game lessons ways of ensuring that parents know which video games are suitable for children are to be considered by the games industry.  the issue was discussed at a meeting between uk government officials  industry representatives and the british board of film classification. it follows concerns that children may be playing games aimed at adults which include high levels of violence. in 2003  britons spent £1 152m on games  more than ever before. and this christmas  parents are expected to spend millions on video games and consoles.  violent games have been hit by controversy after the game manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old stefan pakeerah  who was stabbed to death in leicester in february. his mother  giselle  said her son s killer  warren leblanc  17 - who was jailed for life in september - had mimicked behaviour in the game.  police investigating stefan s murder dismissed its influence and said manhunt was not part of its legal case. the issue of warnings on games for adults was raised on sunday by trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt. this was the focus of the talks between government officials  representatives from the games industry and the british board of film classification.  adults can make informed choices about what games to play. children can t and they deserve to be protected   said culture secretary tessa jowell after the meeting.  industry will consider how to make sure parents know what games their children should and shouldn t play.  roger bennett  director general of entertainment and leisure software publishers association  said:  a number of initiatives were discussed at the meeting.  they will be formulated to create specific proposals to promote greater understanding  recognition and awareness of the games rating system  ensuring that young people are not exposed to inappropriate content.   among the possible measures could be a campaign to explain to parents that many games are made for an adult audience  as well as changes to the labelling of the games themselves.  according to industry statistics  a majority of players are over 18  with the average age of a gamer being 29. academics point out that there has not been any definitive research linking bloodthirsty games such as manhunt with violent responses in players. in a report published this week for the video standards council  dr guy cumberbatch said:  the research evidence on media violence causing harm to viewers is wildly exaggerated and does not stand up to scrutiny.  dr cumberbatch  head of the social policy think tank  the communications research group  reviewed the studies on the issue. he concluded that there was an absence of convincing research that media violence caused harm.,-0.93225765
1859,tech,camera phones are  must-haves  four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year  says a report from analysts gartner.  globally  the number sold will reach 159 million  an increase of 104%. the report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly  must-have  buy. in europe  cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. but in japan and asia pacific  where camera phone technology is much more advanced  mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. japan still dominates mobile phone technology  and the uptake there is huge. by 2008  according to gartner  95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.  camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them  as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms (multimedia messaging services). this has changed in the last 18 months. handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways  they have introduced more design features  like rotating screens and viewfinders  removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.  mobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. these have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites  or mobile blogs - moblogs. but the report suggests that until image quality increases more  people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. the gartner report suggests that by mid-2005  it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality  and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. but a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. some handsets already feature limited zoom capability  and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions  like nightclubs. other developments include wide-angle modes  basic editing features  and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.  images from camera phones have even made it into the art world. an exhibition next month in aid of the charity mencap  will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.  the exhibition  fonetography  will feature images taken by photographers david bailey  rankin and nan goldin  and artists sir peter blake  tracey emin and jack vettriano. but some uses for them have worried many organisations. intel  samsung  the uk s foreign office and lawrence livermore national laboratories in the us  have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. many schools  fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. italy s information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers  profits. according to recent figures  sony ericsson s profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to september featured integrated cameras  it said.,-0.14960909

745,business,china continues breakneck growth china s economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004  faster than predicted and well above 2003 s 9.1%.  the news may mean more limits on investment and lending as beijing tries to take the economy off the boil. china has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion  which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats. but officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed  with services providing much of the impetus. growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004  down from 17% the previous year.  still  consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004  adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. and overall investment in fixed assets was still high  up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. the result could be higher interest rates. china raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in october 2004.  despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong  economists said.  there is no sign of a slowdown in 2005   said tim congdon  economist at ing barings.  china s economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand  but also from soaring sales overseas. figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004  up 35%. part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan  china s currency. the government keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the us dollar  - much to the chagrin of many us lawmakers who blame china for lost jobs and competitiveness. despite urging to ease the peg  officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate.  we need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time   national bureau of statistics chief li deshui told reuters.  those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.,0.51056767

599,tech,anti-spam screensaver scrapped a contentious campaign to bump up the bandwidth bills of spammers by flooding their sites with data has been dropped.  lycos europe s make love  not spam campaign began in late november but its tactics proved controversial. lycos has shut down the campaign saying it had been started to stimulate debate about anti-spam measures and had now achieved this aim. the anti-spammer screensaver came under fire for encouraging vigilante activity and skirting the edge of the law.  through the make love  not spam website  users could download a screensaver that would endlessly request data from the net sites mentioned in many junk mail messages. more than 100 000 people are thought to have downloaded the screensaver that lycos europe offered.  the company wanted to keep the spam sites running at near total capacity to make it much less financially attractive to spammers to operate the sites. but the campaign was controversial from the moment it kicked off and many net veterans criticised it for using spamming-type tactics against the senders of junk mail. some net service firms began blocking access to the lycos europe site in protest at the action. monitoring firm netcraft found that the anti-spam campaign was proving a little too successful. according to response-time figures gathered by netcraft  some of the sites that the screensaver targeted were being knocked offline by the constant data requests. in a statement from lycos europe announcing the scrapping of the scheme  the company denied that this was its fault.  there is nothing to suggest that make love  not spam has brought down any of the sites that it has targeted   it said.  at the time that netcraft measured the sites it claims may have been brought down  they were not in fact part of the make love  not spam attack cycle   it added. the statement issued by lycos also said that the centralised database it used ensured that traffic to the target sites left them with 5% spare capacity.  the idea was simply to slow spammers  sites and this was achieved by the campaign   the company said. many security organisations said users should not participate in the lycos europe campaign. the closure comes only days after the campaign was suspended following the outbreak of criticism.,3.2083461

871,entertainment,dvd review: spider-man 2 it s a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good. but spider-man 2 breaks that rule in two.  it s not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of spidey versus doc ock and more so into the fate of poor peter parker. gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning. a few effects look false but tobey maguire  kirsten dunst and alfred molina make this compelling. the other universal rule is that dvds of superhero films will have making of features only about the effects. this disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film. then there are commentaries  trailers and a blooper reel.  sometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than 34 john wayne films ranging from the westerns and war movies to the quiet man.  now is that a christmas present or what  give this to someone on 24 december and you won t see them again until early in the new year. it s not truly a complete collection and leans more toward wayne s earlier films: there s no true grit  for instance  though there is hellraisers. the films look well transferred to dvd  though none has extras.  it was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous 1979 series became a cult favourite that s been long awaited on dvd. this set has the first season of buck (gil gerard) and wilma s (erin gray) tongue-in-cheek adventures and it s all as camp and gaudy as you remember. but it s also a disappointment. the us dvd has this and the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price. the bigger omission  though  is that there are no extras. that s particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars gerard and gray had agreed to do them.,-2.7932806

1268,tech,remote control rifle range debuts soon you could go hunting via the net.  a texas company is considering letting web users use a remote-controlled rifle to shoot down deer  antelope and wild pigs. for a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a 133-hectare texas ranch. the live-shot website behind the scheme already lets people practise shooting at targets via the internet.  john underwood  the man behind the live-shot website  said the idea for the remote-control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site.  we were looking at a beautiful white-tail buck and my friend said  if you just had a gun for that . a little light bulb went off in my head   mr underwood told the reuters news agency. a year s work and $10 000 has resulted in a remote-controlled rig on which sits a camera and .22 calibre rifle. mr underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals. also needed is a fast net connection so remote hunters can quickly track and aim at passing game animals with the camera and rifle rig. each remote hunting session will cost $150 with additional fees for meat processing and taxidermy work. species that can be shot will include barbary  corsican and mouflon sheep  blackbuck antelope and wild pigs. already the live-shot site lets people shoot 10 rounds at paper and silhouette targets for $5.95 for each 20-minute shooting session. for further fees  users can get the target they shot and a dvd recording of their session. handlers oversee each shooting session and can stop the gun being fired if it is being aimed off-range or at something it should not be. mr underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to texas. in a statement the rspca said it had  grave concerns  about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle.  we assume it would be extremely difficult to accurately control a gun in this way and therefore it would be difficult to ensure a  clean kill   something the rspca accepts is the intention of those shooting for sport   it said.  animals hit but not killed would without doubt be caused to suffer unnecessarily   said the statement. mike berger  wildlife director of the texas parks and wildlife department  said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting. he said state laws on hunting only covered  regulated animals  such as native deer and bird species. as such there was nothing to stop mr underwood letting people hunt  unregulated  imported animals and wild pigs. mr underwood also lets people come in person to the ranch to hunt and shoot game animals.,-1.4001398

414,politics,brown and blair face new rift claims for the umpteenth time  tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other.  this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government s global aid and debt initiatives  particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things. it dominated the prime minister s monthly news conference  which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour. as he told journalists:  i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers. there is a complete unity of purpose.  and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job  and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election.  so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown s long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt  he was asked  by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference. well  not really  as it happens.  and he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were  before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers  preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world. although in the next breath he declared:  i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers  before catching himself on and quickly adding:  in so far as i read them of course.  he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men.  as far as the timing of the prime minister s press conference is concerned  there are two options. the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment. if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling. the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence  which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements - through the infamous downing street grid - to avert just such allegations.  either way  the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue. and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men. firstly  the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries. it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government s response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt.  then  as if to pour fuel on the flames  both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw  aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott - without mentioning the other. all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had  as a result  started to set out his own platform. the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed  should  be in the manifesto  has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission - often seen as the prime minister s  turf  - has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other. the prime minister denied all that as well  repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign. but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that  unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry  it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself.,0.99315405
958,business,japan economy slides to recession the japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade.  gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004. the fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending  and follows similar falls in gdp in the two previous quarters. the tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced  but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year. on wednesday  the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which  when taking into account performance in the most recent period  effectively tips japan into recession.  a previous estimate of 0.1% growth between july and september was downgraded to a 0.3% decline. a recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth  although the japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy.  figures released by the government s cabinet office showed that gdp  on an annualised basis  fell 0.5% in the last three months of 2004. however  politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year.  the economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture  it is in a recovery stage   said economic and fiscal policy minister heizo takenaka. gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country.  the economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at gdp alone   mr takenaka stressed.  ministers pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter. analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that japan s largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise. japan s economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005. however  the economy s fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending  a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies.  the results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn t be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy   said naoki iizuka  senior economist at the dai-ichi life research institute. japan s economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession.,-1.8140063

1732,tech,mobiles  not media players yet  mobiles are not yet ready to be all-singing  all-dancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players  say two reports.  despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles  people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life  said jupiter. a separate study by gartner has also said real-time tv broadcasts to mobiles is  unlikely  in europe until 2007. technical issues and standards must be resolved first  said the report. batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer  like video playback  video messaging  megapixel cameras and games amongst others. bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life.  fifty percent of europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone  but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets.  mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready   said thomas husson  mobile analyst at jupiter research.  mobile music services should be new and different  and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches.  other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones  compared to portable players which can hold up to 40gb of music. the mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading  after the success of apple s itunes  napster and other net music download services.  with phones getting smarter and more powerful  there are also demands to be able to watch tv on the move. in the us  services like tivo to go let people transfer pre-recorded tv content onto their phones. but  the gartner report on mobile tv broadcasting in europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. currently  tv-like services  where clips are downloaded  are offered by several european operators  like italy s tim and 3. mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though  said the report.  various standards and ways of getting tv signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. in europe  trials in berlin and helsinki are making use of terrestrial tv masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. a service from the norwegian broadcasting corporation lets people watch tv programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day. the service uses 3gp technology  one of the standards for mobile tv. but at the end of 2004  the european telecommunications institute (etsi) formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld (dvb-h) as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe. operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles  as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. the cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. handsets also need to be able to work with the dvb-h standard. tv services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation too  which expects good quality images at low prices  according to analysts. people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens  said gartner. digital video recorders  like europe s sky+ box  and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch. as a result  people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control. more powerful smartphones like the xda ii  nokia 6600  sonyericsson p900 and the orange e200  offering web access  text and multimedia messaging  e-mail  calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. a report by analysts instat/mdr has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44% over the next five years. it says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009.,0.95435476
1476,business,dollar slides ahead of new year the us dollar has hit a new record low against the euro and analysts predict that more declines are likely in 2005.  disappointing economic reports dented the currency  which had been rallying after european policy makers said they were worried about the euro s strength. earlier on thursday  the japanese yen touched its lowest versus the euro on concerns about economic growth in asia. currency markets have been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. this has amplified reactions  analysts said  adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in january.   people want to go into the weekend and the new year positioned for a weaker buck   said tim mazanec  director of foreign exchange at investors bank and trust. the dollar slid to a record $1.3666 versus the euro on thursday  before bouncing back to $1.3636. against the yen the dollar was trading down at $103.05.  the yen  meanwhile  dropped to 141.60 per euro in afternoon trading. it later strengthened to 140.55. investors are concerned about the size of the us trade and budget deficits and are betting that george w bush s administration will allow the dollar to weaken despite saying they favour a strong currency. also playing on investors  minds are mixed reports about the state of the us economy. on thursday  disappointing business figures from chicago brought a sudden end to a rally in the value of the dollar. the national association of purchasing management-chicago said its index dropped to 61.2  more than analysts had expected. german chancellor gerhard schroeder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro. mr berlusconi said the euro s strength was  absolutely worrying  for italian exports. mr schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances.,2.8020017

959,business,optimism remains over uk housing the uk property market remains robust despite the recent slowdown  according to mortgage lender bradford & bingley and housebuilder george wimpey.  b&b said the buy-to-let market - in which the bank is a major player - would continue to grow much faster than the wider mortgage market. the comments came as it reported a 6% rise in profits to £280.2m ($532m). wimpey reported a 19% rise in profits to £450.7m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected.  recent housing market surveys have indicated that the uk property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth. last week  figures from the council of mortgage lenders (cml) indicated that the popularity of buy-to-let mortgages - a key phenomenon of the housing boom - could be waning.  but b&b - which has a 22% share of the uk buy-to-let mortgage market - said that while rates of growth were moderating  the sector  continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market . overall  b&b said that  housing market fundamentals remain strong .  interest rates and unemployment are both likely to remain at historically low levels  real household incomes should continue to grow and housing demand is likely to outstrip supply into the medium-term.  despite the upbeat tone  shares in b&b were down more than 4% at 325.5p in morning trade as analysts worried over future earnings growth.  wimpey s profit figures came in at the top of expectations  with the numbers helped by buoyant sales in the us offsetting a slight slowdown in the uk. wimpey said the uk housing market had proved  challenging  last year.  by late summer  the market in general had slowed sharply across the country and showed no real improvement during the autumn   it added. however  the first seven weeks of this year had produced promising signs  wimpey said.  visitor levels and interest in this period have been encouraging and reservations have been at the stronger end of our expectations.  shares in wimpey were up 6% at 458.5p in morning trade.,1.6508105
154,tech,google s toolbar sparks concern search engine firm google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites.  the autolink feature comes with google s latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to amazon.com if it finds a book s isbn number on the site. it also links to google s map service  if there is an address  or to car firm carfax  if there is a licence plate. google said the feature  available only in the us   adds useful links . but some users are concerned that google s dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like amazon.  autolink works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage - even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission.  if a user clicks the autolink feature in the google toolbar then a webpage with a book s unique isbn number would link directly to amazon s website. it could mean online libraries that list isbn book numbers find they are directing users to amazon.com whether they like it or not. websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services. dan gillmor  founder of grassroots media  which supports citizen-based media  said the tool was a  bad idea  and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth . in a statement google said the feature was still only in beta  ie trial  stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users. it said:  the user can choose never to click on the autolink button  and web pages she views will never be modified.  in addition  the user can choose to disable the autolink feature entirely at any time.   the new tool has been compared to the smart tags feature from microsoft by some users. it was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised. smart tags allowed microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company. google said none of the companies which received autolinks had paid for the service. some users said autolink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any  click through  to a commercial site. cory doctorow  european outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group electronic fronter foundation  said that google should not be penalised for its market dominance.  of course google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses.  but as an end user i would want to know -  can i choose to use this service    how much is google being paid     can i substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by google  .  mr doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using autolink or  tricked into using the service .,1.7129078

702,politics,escaped prisoner report ordered first minister jack mcconnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded.  michael ferguson  36  escaped after being allowed out of the high-security carstairs unit. the snp s nicola sturgeon has demanded to know who was responsible for signing off the leave. the scottish executive said ministers would be notified but it would  not be common practice  to sign approval. an executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report. ministerial responsibility for carstairs rests with rhona brankin  the deputy health minister. ms brankin said:  the first minister has called for a review of what has happened  we need to talk to the state hospital and we need to reflect on this.  ms sturgeon has written to mr mcconnell asking for clarification on the move to allow the prisoner out. she said questions must be answered about his escape  if the public is to be reassured about safety. police are still searching for ferguson  who failed to return after a trip to east kilbride on monday.  the scottish national party s parliamentary leader argued that under the law  authorisation of ferguson s leave of absence would have come directly from ministers. she said:  the scottish executive seemed to indicate yesterday that the escape of mr ferguson was a matter for carstairs.  however  my understanding is that  under the mental health legislation  the decision to grant this patient - and any restricted patient - leave of absence  would have required direct and specific authorisation by scottish ministers.  she added:  i have written to the first minister today asking for confirmation of that fact. i have also asked him to confirm which minister would routinely take decisions of this nature and what information they are based on.  this is not an attempt to apportion blame  but to ensure a better understanding of the decision making process in such important and sensitive cases.   police said ferguson posed a danger to the public. bbc scotland political correspondent glenn campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation. he said:  we understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for michael ferguson to be released unescorted from carstairs.  the executive concedes that it is up to scottish ministers  they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave  but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it.  but at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not a serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised.  scottish conservative leader  david mcletchie  said earlier it was  almost beyond belief that this has been allowed to happen .  the executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by a psychiatric advisor  in conjunction with officials on behalf of ministers . she said:  ministers were told of that  notified of it  but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off.  they do have statutory responsibility  but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision.  ferguson  who slashed a man in a doctors  surgery in coatbridge in 1994  had been out to see his fianc&#233;e annabella holmes  47  whom he met when she was a patient at the high security complex in south lanarkshire. he is described as being 5ft 9ins tall  slim  with blond hair  blue eyes and a fair complexion. ferguson was wearing a black jacket  grey jeans  black jumper and black shoes when he was last seen. he has multiple fading tattoos on his left hand and a very faded tear tattoo under his left eye. ms holmes is not missing but there have been no sightings of ferguson since monday. strathclyde police asked anyone who spots ferguson to contact sergeant keith mcdonald on  .,0.46668577
2214,business,bush budget seeks deep cutbacks president bush has presented his 2006 budget  cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at $427bn (£230bn) this year.  the $2.58 trillion (£1.38 trillion) budget submitted to congress affects 150 domestic programmes from farming to the environment  education and health. but foreign aid is due to rise by 10%  with more money to treat hiv/aids and reward economic and political reform. military spending is also set to rise by 4.8%  to reach $419.3bn. the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan  for which the administration is expected to seek an extra $80bn from congress later this year.  congress will spend several months debating george w bush s proposal.  the state department s planned budget would rise to just under $23bn - a fraction of the defence department s request - including almost $6bn to assist us allies in the  war on terror . however  the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle hiv/aids  the bbc s jonathan beale reports  and planned spending would almost double to $3bn  with much of that money going to african nations. mr bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his millennium challenge corporation. the scheme has been set up to reward developing countries that embrace what the us considers to be good governance and sound policies. yet mr bush s proposed spending of $3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of $5bn.  a key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration s proposed radical overhaul of social security  the pensions programme on which many americans rely for their retirement income.  some experts believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5 trillion over a 20-year period. neither does the budget include any cash to purchase crude oil for the us emergency petroleum stockpile. concern over the level of the reserve  created in 1970s  has led to rises in oil prices over the past year. the bush administration will instead continue to fill the reserve by taking oil - rather than cash - from energy companies that drill under federal leases.  the outline proposes reductions in budgets at 12 out of 23 government agencies including cuts of 9.6% at agriculture and 5.6% at the environmental protection agency. the spending plan for the year beginning 1 october is banking on a healthy us economy to boost government income by 6.1% to $2.18 trillion. spending is forecast to grow by 3.5% to $2.57 trillion. but the budget is still the tightest yet under mr bush s presidency.  in order to sustain our economic expansion  we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government   mr bush said in his budget message to congress. mr bush has promised to halve the us s massive budget deficit within five years. the deficit  partly the result of massive tax cuts early in mr bush s presidency  has been a key factor in pushing the us dollar lower. the independent congressional budget office estimates that the shortfall could shrink to little more than $200bn by 2009  returning to the surpluses seen in the late 1990s by 2012. but its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent  in line with the promise when they were passed that they would  sunset   or disappear  in 2010. most republicans  however  want them to stay in place. and the figures also rely on the  social security trust fund  - the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions - being offset against the main budget deficit.,-1.4406471
1370,business,markets fall on weak dollar fears rising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on monday after a finance ministers  meeting and stern words from fed chief alan greenspan.  the london ftse fell 0.8% while tokyo s nikkei 225 dropped 2.11%  its steepest fall in three months. g20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar  whose slide could further jeopardise growth in japan and europe. and mr greenspan warned asian states could soon stop funding the us deficit.  on monday afternoon  the euro was close to an all-time high against the dollar at above $1.30. oil pushed higher too on monday  as investors fretted about cold weather in the us and europe and a potential output cut from oil producers  group opec  although prices had cooled by the end of the day. in london  the benchmark brent crude price closed down 51 cents at $44.38 a barrel  while new york light sweet crude closed down 25 cents at $48.64 a barrel. the slide comes as the us has been attempting to talk up the traditional  strong dollar  policy.  the latest to pitch in has been president george w bush himself  who told the asia pacific economic co-operation (apec) summit in chile that he remained committed to halving the budget deficit. together with a $500bn trade gap  the red ink spreading across america s public finances is widely seen as a key factor driving the dollar lower. and last week us treasury secretary john snow told an audience in the uk that the policy remained unaltered. but he also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets - a signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar. some had looked to the g20 meeting for direction. but mr snow made clear exchange rates had not been on the agenda.  for the us government  letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term fix.  us exports get more affordable  helping perhaps to close the trade gap. in the meantime  the debt keeps getting bigger  with congress authorising an $800bn rise in what the us can owe - taking the total to $8.2 trillion. but in a speech on friday  federal reserve chairman alan greenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky. at present  much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to asian states such as japan and china  since the dollar is seen as the world s reserve currency. similarly  asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the us as a whole spends and what it earns. but already they are turning more cautious - an auction of debt in august found few takers. and mr greenspan said that could turn into a trend  if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the value of those investments.  it seems persuasive that  given the size of the us current account deficit  a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point   he said.,1.0516486

403,business,russian oil merger excludes yukos the merger of russian gas giant gazprom and oil firm rosneft is to go ahead  but will not include yugansk  which was controversially bought last year.  the merger  backed by russian authorities  will allow foreigners to trade in gazprom shares. gazprom chief alexei miller confirmed rosneft-owned yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off. under the agreement  the state will get a controlling share of gazprom in exchange for rosneft. the state wanted to control gazprom before allowing foreigners to trade. speaking on ntv television  which is controlled by gazprom  mr miller added that yugansk  which was swallowed up by rosneft late last year  will operate as a separate  state-owned oil firm headed by current rosneft chief sergei bogdanchikov. according to reports from russian news agency interfax  the deal should go through in the next two to three months.   obtaining majority control over gazprom is the beginning of the liberalisation of the market in gazprom shares   mr miller added. by opening up trading in gazprom to foreigners  the firm will become a top emerging market play for traders. currently  foreigners can only trade in gazprom via a small issue of london-listed proxy shares.  this is positive news for the international investment community   global asset management investment chief david smith said.  the majority of investors are going to be happy   he added.  however  analysts were disappointed that yugansk would not be included in the deal.  yugansk is a heavy cashflow generator and would have been a much better asset for gazprom   renaissance capital energy analyst adam landes told reuters news agency. but he said the latest development was simply an interim step to allow foreigners to trade in gazprom.  ultimately and industrially  gazprom needs yugansk   he added. analysts said the deal would give gazprom control of 8% of russia s total oil production  an improvement on its current 2.5%  but still far less than the 20% share it would have gained had it also taken over yugansk. however  the merged group will still remain outside russia s top five oil producers - led by lukoil with 11% of the market   followed by tnk-bp which is half owned by bp  and surgutneftegaz. instead  the merged gazprom-rosneft group will rank alongside sibneft with 7% of the market. yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company in a disputed auction in december  following what many thought was a politically-motivated attack on yukos. the shell company was then snapped up by rosneft. yukos unsuccessfully sought to halt the auction by applying for bankruptcy through the us courts. the unit was auctioned by russian authorities to help pay off a $27.5bn back-tax bill.,1.2212043

1221,business,venezuela and china sign oil deal venezuelan president hugo chavez has offered china wide-ranging access to the country s oil reserves.  the offer  made as part of a trade deal between the two countries  will allow china to operate oil fields in venezuela and invest in new refineries. venezuela has also offered to supply 120 000 barrels of fuel oil a month to china. venezuela - the world s fifth largest oil exporter - sells about 60% of its output to the united states. mr chavez s administration  which has a strained relationship with the us  is trying to diversify sales to reduce its dependence on its largest export market.  china s quick-growing economy s need for oil has contributed to record-high oil prices this year  along with political unrest in the middle east and supply bottlenecks. oil prices are finishing the year roughly 30% higher than they were in january 2004.  in 2004  according to forecasts from the ministry of commerce  china s oil imports will be 110m tons  up 21% on the previous year. china has been a net importer of oil since the mid 1990 s with more than a third of the oil and gas it consumes coming from abroad. a lack of sufficient domestic production and the need to lessen its dependence on imports from the middle east has meant that china is looking to invest in other potential markets such as latin america. mr chavez  who is visiting china  said his country would put its many of its oil facilities at the disposal of china. chinese firms would be allowed to operate 15 mature oil fields in the east of venezuela  which could produce more than one billion barrels  he confirmed. the two countries will also continue a joint venture agreement to produce stocks of the boiler fuel orimulsion. mr chavez has also invited chinese firms to bid for gas exploration contracts which his government will offer next year in the western gulf of venezuela. the two countries also signed a number of other agreements covering other industries including mining.,1.803134

1122,business,turkey knocks six zeros off lira turkey is to relaunch its currency on saturday  knocking six zeros off the lira in the hope of boosting trade and powering its growing economy.  the change will see the end of such dizzyingly-high denominations as five million lira - enough for a short taxi ride - and the 20m note  worth $15. these valuations were the product of decades of inflation which  as recently as 2001  was as high as 70%. inflation has since been tamed and economic prospects are improving.  the currency - officially to be known as the new lira - will be launched at midnight on 1 january. from that point  the one-million lira note will become the new one-lira coin. the government hopes the change will be seen as a promise of growing economic stability as turkey embarks on the long process of trying to join the european union.  on an everyday level  it is hoped the change will stimulate more international trade and end confusion among foreign investors and turks alike.  the transition to the new turkish lira shows clearly that our economy has broken the vicious circle that it was imprisoned in for long years   said sureyya serdengecti  head of the turkish central bank.  the new lira is also the symbol of the stable economy that we dreamed of for long years.   the turkish economy teetered on the brink of collapse in 2001 when the lira plunged in value and two million people lost their jobs.  turkey had to turn to the international monetary fund for financial assistance  accepting a $18bn loan in return for pushing through a wide-ranging austerity programme. these tough measures have borne fruit. inflation fell below 10% earlier this year for the first time in decades while exports are up 30% this year. meanwhile  the economy is expanding at a healthy rate  with 7.9% growth expected in 2004. the government hopes that the new currency will cement the country s economic progress  two weeks after eu leaders set a date for the start of turkey s accession talks.  the slimmed-down lira is likely to be widely welcomed by the business community.   the turkish lira has been like funny money   tevfik aksoy  chief turkish economist for deutsche bank  told associated press.  now at least in cosmetic terms it will look like real currency.  however  some do not feel quite so happy about seeing the nominal value of their investments reduced.  if a person has 10 billion lira in investments this will suddenly decrease   shop owner hayriye evren  told associated press.  this will definitely affect people psychologically.,0.07570505

2223,politics,how political squabbles snowball it s become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering.  but this analysis in fact gets it wrong. it s not just children who fight - adults do too. and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going. the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they d be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word.  each participant genuinely wants the row to stop  but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard. their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on. (in the case of mr blair and mr brown  successive books are published  ensuring the issues never die.) now this isn t because the participants are stupid - it s actually each individual behaving entirely rationally  given the incentives facing them. indeed  there s even a piece of economic theory that explains all this. nothing as obscure as  post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory  which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with.  it s often referred to as the  prisoner s dilemma   based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners. the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime  and are locked up in separate cells. but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them  to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime. without a confession  the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge.  clearly the prisoners  best strategy is to keep their mouths shut  and take the short sentence  but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk. he tells each prisoner separately  that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they ll be let off their crime. and he tells them that if they don t confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they ll get life. now  if you are prisoner confronted with this choice  your best bet is to confess. if your partner doesn t confess  you ll get off completely. and if your partner does confess  you d better confess to ensure you don t get life. the result is of course  both prisoners confess  so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. both prisoners  individual logic was to behave that way  even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up. don t worry if you don t entirely follow it - you can to look it up on google  where there are 283 000 entries on it.  the prisoners  dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades. it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively  but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly.  a cold war arms race for example - a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms  rather than a lot of arms. but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other  an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms  results in arms levels that are too high. what economics tells us is that once you re in a prisoners  dilemma - unless you are repeating the experience many times over - it s hard to escape the perverse logic of it. it s no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms  or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on. somehow  the incentives have to change.  in the case of the labour party  if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest  solomon s wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments  solutions which affect the incentives of the participants. an example  is the famous rule that  one divides  the other chooses  as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children. in the case of an apparently endless argument  if you want it to come to an end  you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row. the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing  or one more book for that matter  has to exceed the benefit of having the last word  and getting your point in. if the rest of the party can enforce that  they ll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly.,-3.0623083

654,politics,asylum children to face returns the uk government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to albania.  the trial scheme  which could start in weeks  may be extended to apply to children from other countries. children s charities have reacted with alarm  saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. but the home office says it may be in the children s best interests if it reunites them with their communities.  the pilot  included in the government s five-year immigration plan  aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims.  since 2002  at least 9 000 under-18s have arrived in the uk to seek asylum without other family members. these children automatically become the responsibility of social services. up to now  ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. at least a dozen albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return  according to sources  although there is no public confirmation of numbers. those selected could either be returned to their families  should they be traced  or placed in the care of other albanian authorities. separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.  under the 1989 children act  public bodies have a duty to act in the  best interest  of a child in their care. laura brownlees of save the children said there were grave concerns  not least because of the well-documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in albania.   if children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis   she said.  we do not think there are structures in place [to receive returning children in albania].  if these decisions are not in the best interests of the child  then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision.  in its five-year immigration plan  announced on tuesday  the government said it was addressing  the difficult issue  of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. a spokesman for the home office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children  and leave them to rot .  we are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused   said the spokesman.  we have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it s possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.   we do not believe that it is right  or in keeping with children s legislation  that children who can return should remain in the uk indefinitely separated from their families and communities.  the spokesman stressed the uk would abide by its international human rights obligations. only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned  he said. but andrew hogg  spokesman for the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture  said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies.  from what is so far known  we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account   said mr hogg.  in albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure.  the medical foundation has many serious concerns  including the assessment process for suitability for return  the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare  and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries.  a spokesman for the albanian embassy in london said it was the first it had heard of a scheme  but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.,0.68339443

1215,sport,wru proposes season overhaul the welsh rugby union wants to restructure the northern hemisphere season into four separate blocks.  the season would start with the celtic league in october  followed by the heineken cup in february and march  and the six nations moved to april and may. after a nine week break  the wru then proposes a two-month period of away and home international matches. wru chairman david pickering said the structure would end problems of player availability for club and country. he added:  we feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation.  equally  we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in a continuous tournament and hopefully  the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure.  moving the six nations from its traditional february beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and  stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing   pickering argued. the plan will be put before the international rugby board next month  where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for a global integrated season will also be discussed. pickering added:  it s very early days and there are a number of caveats associated with it - not least the revenue from the broadcasters  which is extremely important.  we ve got a good plan and one which should be judged on its merits.,-2.2640653
370,tech,text messages aid disaster recovery text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in asia.  the messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation. now some are studying how the technology behind sms could be better used during an emergency. sanjaya senanayake works for sri lankan television. the blogging world  though  might know him better by his online name  morquendi. he was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the sri lankan coast. cell phone signals were weak. land lines were unreliable. so mr senanayake started sending out text messages. the messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of  who needs what and where . blogging friends in india took mr senanayake s text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders. thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent.  and that s when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use.  sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call   he says.   in every rural community  there s at least one person who has access to a mobile phone  or has a mobile phone  and can receive messages.  half a world away  in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago  taran rampersad read morquendi s messages. mr rampersad  who used to work in the military  knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster. he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages  and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. mr rampersad said:  imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets  and had a central place to send a text message to that effect.  he can message the server  so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field.  he added:  or  send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region  and they might have an excess of it  and be able to shift supplies to the right places.   mr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september. last week  he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia.  in only 72 hours  he found dan lane  a text message guru living in britain. the pair  along with a group of dedicated techies  are creating what they call the alert retrieval cache. the idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help.  this is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people   says paul saffo  a director at the california-based institute for the future.  you may be halfway around the world from someone  but in cyberspace you re just one click or one e-mail away   he said   that s put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery  where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they re not right on top of the tragedy.  it is still very early days for the project  though. in an e-mail  dan lane calls it  an early proof of concept.  right now  the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page  or distribute it to an e-mail list. in the near future  the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas  and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages. but there s still another challenge. you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use.  it s amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to  and say  look this is what we re trying to do and everything like that   says mr rampersad.  so the big problem right now is the same problem we re trying to solve - human communication.  he is optimistic  however. he thinks that the alert retrieval cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments  too  will sit up and take notice. and he stands by his motto  courtesy of michelangelo: criticise by creating.  clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world  a bbc world service and wgbh-boston co-production.,-0.5032692

405,sport,o gara revels in ireland victory ireland fly-half ronan o gara hailed his side s 19-13 victory over england as a  special  win.  the munster number 10 kicked a total of 14 points  including two drop goals  to help keep alive their grand slam hopes. he told bbc sport:  we made hard work of it but it s still special to beat england.  i had three chances to win the game but didn t. we have work to do after this but we never take a victory over england lightly.  ireland hooker shane byrne echoed o gara s comments but admitted the game had been england s best outing in the six nations. byrne said:  it was a really  really hard game but from one to 15 in our team we worked really  really hard.  we just had to stick to our defensive pattern  trust ourselves and trust those around us. all round it was fantastic.  ireland captain brian o driscoll  who scored his side s only try  said:  we are delighted  we felt if we performed well then we would win but with england also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter.  we did get the bounce of the ball and some days that happens and you ve just got to jump on the back of it.   ireland coach eddie o sullivan was surprised that england coach andy robinson said he was certain mark cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break.  andy was sitting two yards from me and i couldn t see whether he was offside or not so i don t know how andy could have known   said o sullivan.   what i do know is that england played well and when that happens it makes a very good victory for us.  we had to defend for long periods and that is all good for the confidence of the team.  i think our try was very well worked  it was a gem  as good a try as we have scored for a while.  o sullivan also rejected robinson s contention england dominated the forward play.  i think we lost one lineout and they lost four or five so i don t know how that adds up to domination   he said. o driscoll also insisted ireland were happy to handle the pressure of being considered favourites to win the six nations title.  this season for the first time we have been able to play with the favourites  tag   he said.  hopefully we have proved that today and can continue to keep doing so.  as for my try it was a move we had worked on all week. there was a bit of magic from geordan murphy and it was a great break from denis hickie.,-0.058125973
1011,business,making your office work for you our mission to brighten up your working lives continues - and this time  we re taking a long hard look at your offices.  over the next few months  our panel of experts will be listening to your gripes about where you work  and suggesting ways to make your workspace more efficient  more congenial or simply prettier. this week  we re hearing from marianne petersen  who is planning to convert a barn in sweden into a base for her freelance writing work. click on the link under her photograph to read her story  and then scroll down to see what the panel have to say. and if you want to take part in the series  go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch.  working from home presents a multitude of challenges. understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style. do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others  are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done  do you build on the ideas of others - or are you a more introspective problem solver . in order for a virtual office to succeed  keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential. it may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit  and to keep strict office hours. referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space. it is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours  keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network. isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out  and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry. joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like-minded people may assist. it is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy - with the danger that when the workload eases  they have to be resurrected.    prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight  and the structure is checked for stability. it appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing.  ideally  the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn. this would also allow for a well-insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured. it is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity. in order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating  power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate. ideally  it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities. the walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed  and the walls should be painted in a light colour. the owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks; this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface. i would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn. as for lighting  consider a combination of floor mounted uplights  wall lights (wall washers) and selected downlights. use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior.    please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for marianne s barn.  the layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space. large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available. the finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting  while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace.    regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house  your plan of going wireless is sensible. a wireless router/access point in the house with a wireless lan card in the pc in the renovated area may be sufficient. however  important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass  which could result in a weak signal strength. you may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area. your local it supplier will be able to advise on this. if you haven t already invested in robust firewall and anti-virus software  it is essential to do so  to protect your investment. to really take advantage of wireless technology  you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor. or you could use one of the new tablet computers  which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built-in hand recognition software. and finally  you will save money and space by considering a multi-function product for print  scan  copy and fax.,-2.507937

688,sport,lions blow to world cup winners british and irish lions coach clive woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year s rbs six nations championship.  world cup winners lawrence dallaglio  neil back and martin johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer s tour to new zealand.  i don t think you can ever say never   said woodward.  but i would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby.  dallaglio  back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides. but woodward added:  the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark.  my job  along with all the other senior representatives  is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team.  if you are not playing international rugby then it s still a step up to test rugby. it s definitely a disadvantage.   i think it s absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries.  woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open.  it is an open book   he said.  there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries.  and following the all blacks  impressive displays in europe in recent weeks  including a 45-6 humiliation of france  woodward believes the three-test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge.  their performance in particular against france was simply awesome   said the lions coach.  certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five  but they re a very powerful unit.  with his customary thoroughness  woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland.  as a result  woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots.  scotland s recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances.  eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and i will take on board their opinions.  and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call  provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems.  i took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he wasn t fit and went on the trip.  every player has to be looked at on their own merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and i have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip.  i am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions - and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat.,1.4879761
44,tech,pandas benefit from wireless net the world s dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network.  the wolong nature reserve in the sichuan province of southwest china is home to 20% of the remaining 1 500 giant pandas in the world. a broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas  daily activities. the data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world. the reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology.  using the network  vets have been able to observe how infant pandas feed and suggest changes to improve the tiny cubs  chances of survival.   digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside wolong and with the rest of the world   said zhang hemin  director of the wolong nature reserve.  our researchers now have state-of-the-art digital technology to help foster the panda population and manage our precious surroundings.  the network has been developed by intel  working closely with the staff at wolong. it includes a 802.11b wireless network and a video monitoring system using five cameras to observe pandas around the clock.  before the new infrastructure arrived at the panda park  staff walked or drove to deliver floppy disks across the reserve. infant panda health was recorded on paper notebooks and research teams in the field had little access to the data. to foster cultural links across the globe  a children s learning lab has been incorporated in the network  in collaboration with globio (federation for global biodiversity education for children)  an international non-profit organisation. it will enable children at local primary schools to hook up with their peers in portland  oregon in the us.  digital technology brings this story to life by enabling a global dialogue to help bridge cultures around the world   said globio founder gerry ellis.,-4.646734
313,tech,speech takes on search engines a scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results.  called speegle  it has the look and feel of a normal search engine  with the added feature of being able to read out the results. scottish speech technology firm cec systems launched the site in november. but experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments.  the edinburgh-based firm cec has married speech technology with ever-popular internet search. the ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web.  according to search engine ask jeeves  around 80% of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net. people visiting speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the bbc and reuters.  it is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad   said speegle founder gordon renton.  the system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else.  we are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people  although the royal national institute of the blind (rnib) is looking at the technology   he added. but julie howell  digital policy manager at the rnib  expressed doubts over whether speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people s experience of the web.  there are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be   she said.  blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way   she added.  the site uses a technology dubbed panavox  which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech. in the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but cec says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dial-up connections. visitors to speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known  if silent  search engine google. google has no connection with speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments  said mr renton.  it is not a rip-off. we are doing something that google does not do and is not planning to do and there is truth in the saying that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery   he said. speegle is proving popular with those learning english in countries such as japan and china.  the site is bombarded by people just listening to the words. the repetition could be useful although they may all end up talking like robots   said mr renton.,0.70903015
1604,politics,kilroy launches  veritas  party ex-bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy-silk said he wanted to  change the face of british politics  as he launched his new party. mr kilroy-silk  who recently quit the uk independence party  said  our country  was being  stolen from us  by mass immigration. he told a london news conference that veritas - latin for  truth  - would avoid the old parties   lies and spin . ukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk.  mr kilroy-silk promised a  firm but fair  policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime  tax  pensions  health and defence over the next few weeks. labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said veritas was joining  an already crowded field on the right of british politics . on thursday mr kilroy-silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon s ashfield seat. he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip s two london assembly members  damien hockney who is now veritas  deputy leader. ukip s chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.  mr kilroy-silk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had  gone awol  after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june s european elections.  while ukip has turned its back on the british people  i shall not   he said.  i will be standing at the next general election. i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in.  and  unlike the old parties  we shall be honest  open and straight.   mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy-silk would  deliver better  as the leader of a eurosceptic party. a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly. the party asserts that mr hockney  has a moral obligation  if not a legal one  to stand down. its leader  roger knapman  has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk.  he has remarkable ability to influence people but  sadly  after the [european] election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him  now  goodbye    he said. ukip officials also argue mr kilroy-silk has not been  straightforward  in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.  veritas  it s the bnp in an expensive suit!  it s all well and good robert kilroy-silk claiming  that  veritas  is a party that doesn t believe in  lies and spin   but the truth of the matter is  its completely useless  due to proportional representation  there is no chance that  veritas  will have any chance in claiming power  and change the two-horse race trend. in my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke-screen for his anti-islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television.  i think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many. it really is time that the uk government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue. in addition as an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy -silk opposing geoff hoon!!  good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done. let s hope kilroy-silk  ukip and the euro-sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe. we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu  we need to be at the heart of europe  leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go  not running away from it.  all mouth and trousers. a clown. trouble is  any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into a third term.  whatever kilroy-silk and ukip do  none of their anti-european policies have any relevance outside middle england. this new party might gain support from right-wing england  but will have little impact in wales or scotland.  hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue. england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better  we can t rely on the usa forever!  at last an impetus for increasing the likely 40% turn out for the election. the electorate is disillusioned with british politics. kilroy has one agenda - the uk - and i ll be voting for him.  both ukip and rk-s are representatives of small-mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind. the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people s bickering that who  in the overall scheme of things  really cares about their petty tiff   many people believe you kilroy. you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility.  the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating. one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls.  i ve always thought that kilroy-silk was a self-publicising  egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion.  brilliant  about time this country had a plausible party!  having seen the recent bbc 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroy-silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people. hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action.  fantastic news. pro-europeans now have far less to worry about from the right. the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid-1990s  and the extreme anti-europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local  european and general elections. robert kilroy-silk s ego and vanity are his own (and his supporters ) worst enemy.  as a euro-enthusiast i could not be more delighted by kilroy-silk s behaviour. he took a party that was just building up a head of steam  and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup-d etat  he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two. the closer to straight-down-the-middle the better  as far as i am concerned  but in any eventuality  the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other.  if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose  we d have ballot papers a mile long! you ve got to hand it to kilroy-silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self-belief.  whilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership  and like him i am also leaving ukip. i believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means. the eu s comments last week about michael howard s plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the eu and not individual member states. the sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better  does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro-sceptic kilroy-silk has used a latin name for his new party  rather than a  good old british  name  is this indicative of the man - contradictory  vain and pompous   i think mr kilroy-silk has got a very good point. british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians. they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power. as a result i feel our democracy is being abused and i want it stopped. if mr kilroy-silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.  honestly  who really cares  man with tan leaves party with no plan  to set up party with no idea.  as one of kilroy-silk s east midlands constituents i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity. i feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament.  ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk  but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him. someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukip s democratic nature.  kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician  in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not. he tried to make it work  but they didn t seem to want to grow up. he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media. this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy. good luck to the man  i say.  oh please! this is an amusing irrelevance. there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive  eurosceptic  argument. they will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed  more democratic  more dynamic europe union. future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness.  the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open  honest and straight. what other politician can claim this. i have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like. i shall be voting for him.  the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroy-silk but for the ukip. kilroy-silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukip s party list. he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament.  i wouldn t write off kilroy-silk. while he s a clown and a one man band at the moment  he s a populist and that s always dangerous.the man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters  that seems to be one of the factors in success.  good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle.  the man i once found cringe worthy on day time tv  could well turn out to be my country s knight in shining armour. he expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today - but people are almost too scared to express them. kilroy silk has secured my vote  and many more like me. what s more  i look forward to the day when he claims victory  wrecks the eu  and rescues my great nation... without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever!  great stuff. the longer the uk dithers over europe  the richer we in ireland become  as the only english-speaking country fully committed to europe. oh and send us over those hard-working immigrants - our economy needs them.  this is just what the europhiles pray for. as the main eurosceptic party  ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe. having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.  thank goodness that kilroy-silk has gone - now ukip at least has a chance in the election!  it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip. robert kilroy-silk could have a lot to offer. instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. under the present electoral system  people must work together  and small parties have no hope of representation. last summer  ukip achieved a major advance  partly and only partly due to kilroy-silk. it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.  ukip has a wide platform of policies  not just withdrawal from the eu. this kilroy-silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy-silk.  if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.  so ukip was good enough for him to lead  not good enough for him to follow!  interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name!  every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-europe feeling in this country. kilroy-silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. we wants quality schools  top hospitals  clean and efficient public transport  punishments that fit the crime  limited asylum  a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. it needs courage and honesty  two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. kilroy-silk may just have those very qualities. recruit the right colleagues  robert  and your time may have come!  well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party. it s all flash and no real policy here  let s hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy-silk slipping into obscurity.  veritas  the name will doom it. but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not  the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism  so explain to me how the too-twee label of veritas symbolises that,3.820374
22,sport,bates seals takeover ken bates has completed his takeover of leeds united.  the 73-year-old former chelsea chairman sealed the deal at 0227 gmt on friday  and has bought a 50% stake in the club. he said:  i m delighted to be stepping up to the mantel at such a fantastic club. i recognise leeds as a great club that has fallen on hard times.  we have a lot of hard work ahead to get the club back where it belongs in the premiership  and with the help of our fans we will do everything we can.  bates bought his stake under the guise of a geneva-based company known as the forward sports fund. he revealed that part of his plan is to buy back leeds  elland road stadium and thorp arch training ground in due course.   it s going to be a tough jon and the first task is to stabilise the cash flow and sort out the remaining creditors   bates added.  but there is light at the end of a very long tunnel. for the past year it has been a matter of firefighting - now we can start running the club again.  outgoing leeds chairman gerald krasner said:  this deal ensures the medium to long term survival of the club and i believe mr bates  proposals are totally for the benefit of the club.  we are content that under mr bates  leeds united will continue to consolidate and move forward.  when we took over leeds united in march 2004  the club had a debt of £103m  since that date  my board has succeeded in reducing the debt to under £25m.  we worked tirelessly to solve all of the problems at leeds united.  eighty percent of the problems have already been overcome and we came to this agreement with mr bates to secure its ongoing success.  krasner revealed that his consortium has been asked to remain in the background at the club for an undisclosed period to help ensure a smooth hand-over. he will stay on in an unpaid capacity while peter lorimer will continue in his role as director and point of contact for the fans and peter mccormick will serve as a consultant to the incoming board. the other outgoing directors have agreed to leave their loans of £4.5m in the company for the next four years. on leeds  new-look board it is understood that lorimer will be joined by former chelsea finance director yvonne todd and bates  lawyer mark taylor.  krasner refused to give any details of the finances involved in the takeover. he told bbc five live:  i am not going into the figures. if ken wants to give them up that is up to him. i can not tell you what the money will be used for.  this dea l is not about money for the current board. in the last four months i never saw any cheques until this week from one person. i am not stretching figures  we don t discuss internal arrangements.  bates stepped down as chelsea chairman in march last year following roman abramovich s £140m takeover at stamford bridge. in may  he made a proposal to invest £10m in sheffield wednesday  but this was rejected by the club. sebastien sainsbury had been close to a takeover of leeds but withdrew his £25m offer last week.  his efforts failed after he revealed it would take £40m to stage a takeover  and that the club will also lose £10m over the next six months. the club was on the brink of administration - and the deduction of 10 points by the football league - before bates  arrival but his investment has spared them that prospect.,0.05860138
788,tech,virus poses as christmas e-mail security firms are warning about a windows virus disguising itself as an electronic christmas card.  the zafi.d virus translates the christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. anti-virus firm sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the zafi virus.  like many other windows viruses  zafi-d plunders microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. to be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. the attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces.  the virus  subject line says  merry christmas  and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. the message in the body of the e-mail reads:  happy holidays  and this too is translated. on infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the pc to hand over control to the writer of the virus. the virus is thought to have spread most widely in south america  italy  spain  bulgaria and hungary. the original zafi virus appeared in april this year.  we have seen these hoaxes for several christmases already  and personally i prefer traditional pen and paper cards  and we recommend this to all our clients too   said mikko hypponen  who heads f-secure s anti-virus team.,3.9502082
1001,entertainment,god cut from dark materials film the director and screenwriter of the film adaptation of philip pullman s his dark materials is to remove references to god and the church in the movie.  chris weitz  director of about a boy  said the changes were being made after film studio new line expressed concern. the books tell of a battle against the church and a fight to overthrow god.  they have expressed worry about the possibility of perceived anti-religiosity   weitz told a his dark materials fans  website. pullman s trilogy has been attacked by some christian teachers and by the catholic press as blasphemy. weitz  who admitted he would not be many people s first choice to direct the films  said he regarded the film adaptation as  the most important work of my life .   in part because it is one of the few books to have changed my life   he told bridgetothestars.net. the award-winning trilogy - northern lights  the subtle knife and the amber spyglass - tell the story of oxford school child lyra belacqua. she is drawn into an epic struggle against the church  which has been carrying out experiments on children in an attempt to remove original sin.  as the books progress the struggle turns into a battle to overthrow the authority  a figure who is god-like in the books. weitz  who directed american pie and about a boy  said new line feared that any anti-religiosity in the film would make the project  unviable financially . he said:  all my best efforts will be directed towards keeping the film as liberating and iconoclastic an experience as i can.  but there may be some modification of terms.   weitz said he had visited pullman  who had told him that the authority could  represent any arbitrary establishment that curtails the freedom of the individual  whether it be religious  political  totalitarian  fundamentalist  communist  what have you . he added:  i have no desire to change the nature or intentions of the villains of the piece  but they may appear in more subtle guises.  there are a number of christian websites which attack the trilogy for their depiction of the church and of god  but pullman has denied his books are anti-religious. his agent told the times newspaper that pullman was happy with the adaptation so far.  of course new line want to make money  but mr weitz is a wonderful director and philip is very supportive.  you have to recognise that it is a challenge in the climate of bush s america,-1.6136165
1194,business,giant waves damage s asia economy governments  aid agencies  insurers and travel firms are among those counting the cost of the massive earthquake and waves that hammered southern asia.  the worst-hit areas are sri lanka  india  indonesia and thailand  with at least 23 000 people killed. early estimates from the world bank put the amount of aid needed at about $5bn (£2.6bn)  similar to the cash offered central america after hurricane mitch. mitch killed about 10 000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998. world bank spokesman damien milverton told the wall street journal that he expected an aid package of financing and debt relief.  tourism is a vital part of the economies of the stricken countries  providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east asian region  according to the world travel and tourism council (wttc). in the maldives islands  in the indian ocean  two-thirds of all jobs depend on tourism.  but the damage covers fishing  farming and businesses too  with hundreds of thousands of buildings and small boats destroyed by the waves. international agencies have pledged their support; most say it is impossible to gauge the extent of the damage yet. the international monetary fund (imf) has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope.   the imf stands ready to do its part to assist these nations with appropriate support in their time of need   said managing director rodrigo rato. only sri lanka and bangladesh currently receive imf support  while indonesia  the quake s epicentre  has recently graduated from imf assistance. it is up to governments to decide if they want imf help. other agencies  such as the asian development bank  have said that it is too early to comment on the amount of aid needed. there is no underestimating the size of the problem  however. the united nations  emergency relief coordinator  jan egeland  said that  this may be the worst national disaster in recent history because it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas... so many vulnerable communities.  many people will have [had] their livelihoods  their whole future destroyed in a few seconds.  he warned that  the longer term effects many be as devastating as the tidal wave or the tsunami itself  because of the risks of epidemics from polluted drinking water.  insurers are also struggling to assess the cost of the damage  but several big players believe the final bill is likely to be less than the $27bn cost of the hurricanes that battered the us earlier this year.   the region that s affected is very big so we have to check country-by-country what the situation is   said serge troeber  deputy head of the natural disasters department at swiss re  the world s second biggest reinsurance firm.  i should assume  however  that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the us   he said. munich re  the world s biggest reinsurer  said:  this is primarily a human tragedy. it is too early for us to state what our financial burden will be.  allianz has said it sees no significant impact on its profitability. however  a low insurance bill may simply reflect the general poverty of much of the region  rather than the level of economic devastation for those who live there.  the international federation of the red cross and red crescent societies told the reuters news agency that it was seeking $6.5m for emergency aid.   the biggest health challenges we face is the spread of waterborne diseases  particularly malaria and diarrhoea   the aid agency was quoted as saying. the european union has said it will deliver 3m euros (£2.1m; $4.1m) of aid  according to the wall street journal. the eu s humanitarian aid commissioner  louis michel  was quoted as saying that it was key to bring aid  in those vital hours and days immediately after the disaster . other countries also are reported to have pledged cash  while the us state department said it was examining what aid was needed in the region. getting companies and business up and running also may play a vital role in helping communities recover from the weekend s events.  many of the worst-hit areas  such as sri lanka  thailand s phuket island and the maldives  are popular tourist resorts that are key to local economies.  december and january are two of the busiest months for the travel in southern asia and the damage will be even more keenly felt as the industry was only just beginning to emerge from a post 9/11 slump. growth has been rapid in southeast asia  with the world tourism organisation figures showing a 45% increase in tourist revenues in the region during the first 10 months of 2004. in southern asia that expansion is 23%.  india continues to post excellent results thanks to increased promotion and product development  but also to the upsurge in business travel driven by the rapid economic development of the country   the wto said.  arrivals to other destinations such as... maldives and sri lanka also thrived.  in thailand  tourism accounts for about 6% of the country s annual gross domestic product  or about $8bn. in singapore the figure is close to 5%. tourism also brings in much needed foreign currency. in the short-term  however  travel companies are cancelling flights and trips. that has hit shares across asia and europe  with investors saying that earnings and economic growth are likely to slow.,1.5072811
760,politics,kilroy-silk attacked with slurry euro mp robert kilroy-silk has had a bucket of farm slurry thrown over him by a protester in manchester.  the uk independence party member was arriving for a bbc radio show when the attacker emerged from behind a bush. fellow guest ruth kelly mp was also hit by the slurry. mr kilroy-silk said the man  who later disappeared  claimed he was  doing it in the name of islam . in january  mr kilroy-silk quit his bbc one show for remarks he made about arabs  who he called  suicide bombers .  mr kilroy-silk had already been taken off air by bbc bosses for the comments  in which he also described arabs as  limb-amputators  women repressors . the remarks prompted outrage among muslim groups. the slurry attack took place on friday as mr kilroy-silk and ms kelly  a cabinet office minister and bolton west mp  arrived at manchester high school for girls for the recording of bbc radio 4 s any questions.  the police were called but the attacker had disappeared by the time officers arrived. they are treating the incident as assault. the programme s host  jonathan dimbleby  later told the audience the mep had been covered from  head to toe . mr kilroy-silk was still able appear to appear on the show after being loaned a change of clothes.  he told reporters he was  very angry  and planned to press charges if his attacker was caught. he said the man shouted:  you ve offended my religion  i m doing this in the name of islam.   as i started to turn round a guy tipped a bucket of farmyard muck over me and then threw the rest of it over me and the car   mr kilroy-silk said.  i was totally covered  it was all through my clothes  and it stank to high heaven. it went all inside the car and splattered ruth kelly.  a bbc spokesman said:  he took his seat as jonathan dimbleby was introducing the show. fortunately someone at the school had a change of clothes to let him have.  greater manchester police said people near mr kilroy-silk had also been hit by the waste. officers took statements at the scene  but no arrests have been made. police say the suspect ran off after towards wilmslow road after committing the offence but is believed to have been driving a red vauxhall corsa earlier. the suspect is described as white  aged 30 to 40  with a ginger beard. police want to hear from anyone who has any information.  mr kilroy-silk  an mep for the east midlands  resigned the uk independence party whip in the european parliament in october  after criticising ukip and stating his ambition to be leader. however  he remains a member of the party. he said on friday he hoped to be elected party leader before christmas.  i think that is sufficient time for us to put in process what is necessary... in time for us to fight and have a significant impact upon the general election.  but a ukip spokesman said that would be impossible under the party s constitution  which requires 70 days before any leadership ballot can take place.,1.3099403

1933,entertainment,fears raised over ballet future fewer children in the uk are following in the dainty footsteps of dancers like darcey bussell  and carving out potential careers as ballet dancers.  new research from the royal academy of dance (rad) has found fewer children over the age of 10 are attending ballet classes and taking exams in the discipline. the organisation blames the growing popularity of computer games and other changes in lifestyle. and there are fears that if the trend is not reversed  there could be fewer british ballet stars in the future. the rad found that the number of youngsters taking their ballet exams drops by almost 70% after the age of 10 or 11. dance teacher eve trew  who has taught ballet for over 48 years  told bbc news she had seen a  vast  change over the years. she blamed modern lifestyles for the fall in ballet attendance.  i think the children of many years ago did not have as many hobbies   she said.  the trouble now is that they are wide open to computers  gameboys and everything else children have got.  as a result  there is less time being spent on ballet lessons.   hazel gilbert  23  an information manager from newcastle  gave up ballet at the age of 10 and is typical of the problem.  it s not a very cool thing to do when you go to  big  school and i think you have to be very focused on ballet to want to carry on doing it   she said.  i used to love it  but after a certain age it becomes much more disciplined and i didn t want that.  i started getting into other things  like swimming and kickboxing  and ballet just wasn t something i wanted to do any more.  ms trew  who runs a dance school in gateshead  admitted it would be  very difficult  to reverse the trend and said many young ballet dancers were no longer willing to make the sacrifices to succeed.  you have to be very dedicated and you have to be very disciplined.  it is a career that you have got to really want to do because it is such hard work.  children these days have not got the time to spend perfecting it... that is very sad.   currently  only two out of 16 principal dancers at the royal ballet - darcey bussell and jonathan cope - are british  compared to 16 of the 21 principals in 1985. but a spokesman for the english national ballet told bbc news that although only two out of their 12 principal dancers were british  around a quarter of the company s dancers were from the uk. he said competition at open auditions in london was  fierce  between talented dancers from all over the world. the rad have launched a new competition to try and reverse the decline in british ballet. dame antoinette sibley  president of the rad  launched the fonteyn nureyev young dancers competition earlier this week.  aimed at children aged 10 to 13  it is hoped the contest will help keep british ballet evolving. a spokeswoman for the rad said:  it is our responsibility to re-ignite the passion and nurture young dancers for the long-term future of ballet.  we need to provide them with a framework and a goal to work towards  with constant support and coaching in an environment where they can work with their peers and possibly leading artists and choreographers.  perhaps more importantly provide them with the opportunity to experience  performance  themselves.  what better way to reignite a passion for ballet than to let them experience the thrill of performance,-4.9376745

1868,tech,hollywood to sue net film pirates the us movie industry has launched legal action to sue people who facilitate illegal film downloading.  the motion picture association of america wants to stop people using the program bittorrent to swap movies. the industry is targeting people who run websites which provide information and internet links to movies which have been copied or filmed in cinemas. more than 100 server operators have been targeted in the actions launched in the us and uk  the mpaa added. the suits were filed against users of the file-sharing programs bittorrent  edonkey and directconnect in the united states  united kingdom  france  finland and the netherlands  the mpaa said.  bittorrent users can download movies by following a link to files which are found on websites called trackers. unlike most peer-to-peer programs bittorrent works by sharing a file  which could be anything from a legitimate digital photo to a copied movie  among multiple users at the same time. the movie industry hopes that suing the people who run the trackers will cut bittorrent users off from illegal movies at source. last month major film studios started legal action against 200 individuals who were swapping films online. the growth in broadband has made it quicker for people to download movies and the industry fears that if it does not take action now  it could suffer the same downturn as the music industry.,2.9951925
1283,sport,wales critical of clumsy grewcock wales coach mike ruddock says england lock danny grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked dwayne peel.  trouble flared at a ruck in the first half of wales  11-9 win in cardiff as grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot  leaving peel bloodied. grewcock was sin-binned with wales captain gareth thomas for retaliation.  it s up to the citing commissioner   said ruddock.  i m not saying it s deliberate  but grewcock did a similar thing for bath against leinster.  last june grewcock was banned from rugby for two months for reckless use of a boot in a match against new zealand.  six years earlier  also in new zealand  grewcock became only the second england player to be sent off in tests. the player himself and his captain jason robinson have both said that the clash with peel was accidental.  if the ball is at the back of the ruck and i feel i can step over and disrupt it then i will do that   said grewcock. but ruddock feels that the england man should be more careful.  the boy himself should look at his actions  it was a clumsy piece of footwork   he said.  he s a great player and i don t want to knock him  we won t be calling for the match commissioner to review the incident.  i m not going to go too far with the lad. it could just be a clumsy action and dwayne had just a minor cut.  the referee s interpretation was that grewcock was attempting to step over the ruck.  ruddock also warned his rbs 6 nations championship rivals that his team can make massive improvements.  we created more opportunities and also squandered them by taking more contact and playing more individually   said the coach.  we ve looked through things on the video debrief and there were definitely a lot of chances that we wasted.  in the forthcoming games  ruddock may use penalty hero gavin henson as his first-choice kicker in place of stephen jones.  our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team  but it s something we ll talk about in selection this week   said ruddock.,0.9728203

1415,tech,row brewing over peer-to-peer ads music download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.  the debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser s dream come true and a branding nightmare. paul myers  chief executive of wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing  oxygen  for companies that support illegal downloading.  you may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service edonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include nat west  vodafone  o2  first direct  ntl  and renault   he said in an open letter to the british phonographic industry last month.  he urged people to follow his lead and  dump  brands associated with companies such as edonkey. the bpi is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks.  networks like edonkey  kazaa and grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. the bpi strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue   it said in a statement.  illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. we are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses   it said. but the issue is often more complicated for advertisers  said mark mulligan  a music analyst with jupiter research.  this has been a problem for a long time  ever since the days of napster   he told the bbc news website.  the reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience.  advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience   he said.  if you put the legality issues aside  not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience   he added. meanwhile companies contacted by the bbc news website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. onetel adverts were spotted on edonkey this week and its response was typical.  we have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. it is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks   read a statement from the discount phone firm. it has requested the advert be removed immediately  said a spokeswoman. similarly telecommunications firm ntl blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. since the matter was brought to its attention last month  the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites  a spokesman told the bbc news website.  however mr mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. while smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends  this is no excuse for well-known brands  he said.  i would be surprised if these brands didn t have the know-how to prevent this happening   he said. at the moment edonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network.  many big brands have leveraged the opportunity  including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - senator john kerry and president george w. bush   said chief executive sam yagan. there are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network  he thinks.  peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they re most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media   he said.,-1.3755398

1376,business,ec calls truce in deficit battle the european commission (ec) has called a truce in its battle with france and germany over breaching deficit limits.  the move came after france and germany vowed to run their budget deficits below the eu cap in 2005 - for the first time in four years. but  the ec did warn the two were under close scrutiny and it would act if their fiscal situations deteriorated. under eu rules  member countries must keep their deficits below 3%. france and germany will breach that this year. it will be the third year in a row that the two countries have broken the european union s stability and growth pact rules.  the eurozone s two biggest economies left the pact in tatters in november 2003 when they persuaded fellow eu members to put the threat of penalties for deficit breaches on hold.  the commission then took the pair to the european court of human justice - which ruled eu countries could not put the pact  in abeyance   and confirmed the ec s right to launch  excessive debt procedures . after announcing its decision to erase france and germany from its list of deficit rule breakers  the eu said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that 2005 should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget s below 3%.  the commission concludes that the two countries appear to be on track to correct their excessive deficits by 2005   it said in a statement. the eu expects the german deficit to fall to fall to 2.9% of gdp next year from 3.9% this year  while france s is forecast to drop to 3% from an expected 3.7% this year. the forecasts are based on ec predictions of gdp growth of 1.5% in germany next year and 2.2% in france.  berlin welcomed the decision  with finance minister hans eichel saying it showed that the ec recognised germany s fiscal policy was  on the right track even amid very difficult economic conditions . however paris was more subdued  with finance minister herve gaymard telling parliament:  we must continue along this path of saving money.  however  the move still had its critics  with the european people s party (epp) attacking the ec for backing down from punitive action.  the commission is buckling under the pressure from germany and france    epp spokesman alexander radwan said.  the scary fact is that budget sinners  despite having repeatedly exceeded the 3% deficit limit  do not have to fear any sanctions.  despite the commission delivering its decision on the two biggest eurozone economies  it refused to comment on similar action against greece which has also broken the 3% deficit ceiling. monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said that it was a matter for next week.,-1.0400252
710,business,criminal probe on citigroup deals traders at us banking giant citigroup are facing a criminal investigation in germany over a controversial bond deal.  the deal saw the sale of 11bn euros ($14.4bn; £7.6bn) of government bonds in a few minutes on 2 august  with 4bn euros-worth then bought back later. the move was widely criticised at the time  and now the german regulator has said it has found evidence of possible market manipulation. citigroup said it would continue to co-operate fully with the authorities.  we are disappointed that the bafin has referred to the prosecutor the question of whether action should be brought against individuals involved   citigroup said. if the traders are found guilty  they could face a five-year jail term or a fine  reuters reported bafin as saying. however  under german criminal law  prosecutors cannot pursue citigroup itself.  germany s financial watchdog bafin told bbc news it had now transferred the investigation to the public prosecutor.  i can confirm that bafin has passed through the case to the public prosecutor   a bafin spokeswoman said.  it is now a criminal investigation.   we found clues of possible market manipulation   the spokeswoman said  which included signs of linked bond trading ahead of the main trades on 2 august.  germany s securities trading act says that if bafin finds such clues  it has to put the case in the hands of the prosecutor.  regulatory investigations are still going on in france  the uk and elsewhere. some citigroup operations elsewhere in the world came under regulatory criticism in 2004. its private banking operation in japan was closed down by regulators in tokyo after an  aggressive sales culture  led the bank to flout anti-money laundering rules.,0.7097211
151,tech,slim playstation triples sales sony playstation 2 s slimmer shape has proved popular with uk gamers  with 50 000 sold in its first week on sale.  sales have tripled since launch  outstripping microsoft s xbox  said market analysts chart-track. the numbers were also boosted by the release of the ps2-only game grand theft auto: san andreas. the title broke the uk sales record for video games in its first weekend of release. latest figures suggest it has sold more than 677 000 copies.   it is obviously very  very encouraging for sony because microsoft briefly outsold them last week   john houlihan  editor of computerandvideogames.com told bbc news.  and with halo 2 [for xbox] out next week  it really is a head-to-head contest between them and xbox.   although xbox sales over the last week also climbed  ps2 sales were more than double that. the figures mean sony is reaching the seven million barrier for uk sales of the console. edinburgh-based developer  rockstar  which is behind the gta titles  has seen san andreas pull in an estimated £24m in gross revenues over the weekend. in comparison  blockbuster films like harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban took £11.5m in its first three days at the uk box office. the lord of the rings: the return of the king took nearly £10m over its opening weekend  although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets.  gangster-themed gta san andreas is the sequel to grand theft auto vice city which previously held the record for the fastest-selling video game ever. the xbox game halo 2  released on 11 november in the uk  is also widely tipped to be one of the best-selling games of the year. the original title won universal acclaim in 2001  and sold more than four million copies.  mr houlihan added that sony had done well with the ps2  but it definitely helped that the release of san andreas coincided with the slimline ps2 hitting the shelves. the run-up to christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles. microsoft s xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales. the sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand  since gta san andreas has an 18 certificate. sony and microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in 2005.  both have hit crucial price points at around £100 and that really does open up new consoles to new audience  plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales   said mr houlihan.,3.5038838

919,politics,eu referendum could cost £80m  it could cost £80m to run a uk referendum on the european constitution  ministers have revealed.  in a written parliamentary answer  constitutional affairs minister chris leslie said the poll was likely to cost the same as a general election. mr leslie said the cost could not be compared with the only previous british referendum  held 30 years ago. ministers say the constitution would make the european union work better but critics fear creating a  super state . labour mp john cryer  whose question revealed the price estimate  said the cost surprised him but was not a central factor as it was important people had their say. but he said it would have been better to have rejected the constitution so avoiding the need for a referendum. the 2001 election cost £80m. no date for the vote has been set but foreign secretary jack straw has suggested it is unlikely to be held until early 2006 - after the predicted date for the next election. most voters said the uk should stay in the common market in the 1975 referendum.,0.83073044
649,tech,mobile networks seek turbo boost third-generation mobile (3g) networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services.  that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3gsm world congress in cannes last week. fast 3g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service  says the global mobile suppliers association. at 3gsm  siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3g networks. the system is not available commercially yet  but motorola  the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker  held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa (high speed downlink packet access)  a high-speed  high bandwidth technology available now. early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second (mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobits per second (kbps) on standard 3g networks.   high-speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) - sometimes called super 3g - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips   according to a report published by uk-based research consultancy analysys. a number of companies are developing the technology. nokia and canada-based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access. the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers.   while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14mbps  practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks   said dr alastair brydon  author of the analysys report: pushing beyond the limits of 3g with hsdpa and other enhancements.  the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which  even at this lower rate  will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic wcdma [3g]   he added. motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3g cell using a single hsdpa device. but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution  data optimised (ev-do).  us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3g network at the end of last year. we are  expanding our network and deploying ev-do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds   said oliver valente  sprint s vice president for technology development  when the contract was announced. as part of $3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year  sprint will spend around $1bn on ev-do technology from lucent technologies  nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits a second  and peak download rates of 2.4mbps. mmo2  the uk-based operator with services in the uk  ireland and germany  has opted for technology based on the high speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) standard. using technology from lucent  it will offer data speeds of 3.6mbps from next summer on its isle of man 3g network  and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4mbps. us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa  using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson.  siemens  plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today  but christoph caselitz  president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that:  by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015  the need for transmission capacities for voice  data  image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10.  siemens - in collaboration with the fraunhofer german-sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae  instead of the usual one. this enables a data transmission  such as sending a big file or video  to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. the speeds offered by3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences. but today  instead of connecting to the internet by slow  dial-up phone connection  many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second - must faster than 3g. this means users are likely to find 3g disappointing unless the networks are souped up. if they aren t  those lucrative  power users   such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks  reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators. but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately. siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory  it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials. a commercial system could be as far away as 2012  though siemens did not rule out an earlier date.,1.2866735
1305,sport,parry relishes anfield challenge bbc sport reflects on the future for liverpool after our exclusive interview with chief executive rick parry.  chief executive parry is the man at the helm as liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history. parry has to deliver a new 60 000-seat stadium in stanley park by 2007 amid claims of costs spiralling above £120m. he is also searching for an investment package of a size and stature that will restore liverpool to their place at european football s top table. but it is a challenge that appears to sit easily with parry  who has forged a reputation as one of football s most respected administrators since his days at the fledgling premier league.  liverpool have not won the championship since 1990  a fact that causes deep discomfort inside anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of chelsea  manchester united and arsenal. throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain steven gerrard  and you can see parry is a man with a lot on his plate. but in the comfort of a conference room deep inside liverpool s heartbeat - the kop end - parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead. he only dodged one question - when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting liverpool  a polite smile deflected the inquiry. but to his credit  he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that liverpool still mean business.  by business he means becoming title challengers again  and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to liverpool is parry s mission. parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager rafael benitez. and his enthusiasm for the spaniard s personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold. benitez s early work has given parry renewed optimism about the years ahead. but it remains a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations. this will not come as news to parry  a lifelong liverpool supporter  but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting...  captain gerrard is central to liverpool s plans and parry s insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent. as ever  the player will have the final say  and parry acknowledges that  but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for liverpool and gerrard to flourish.  in terms of the search for new investment  hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in march 2004. thailand prime minister thaksin shiniwatra came and went  while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan steve morgan. morgan had a succession of bids rejected  having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium. bbc sport understands morgan is still ready and willing to invest in liverpool  and parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere.  morgan  however  has had no formal contact with liverpool or their advisors since last december  blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his £70m offer. he was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others  so any new approach would now have to come from liverpool. morgan will certainly not be making another call. so speculation continues about the new benefactor  with trails leading to the middle east and america  but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from anfield.  parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to liverpool s future  but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea. he is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future liverpool management hostages to the new stadium. parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up  but there has been a vital new development in north london that has re-shaped liverpool s thinking.  liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights - but the realism of arsenal s stunning £100m deal for their new emirates stadium at ashburton has changed the landscape. parry labelled the deal  an eye-opener  and admits liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities. he knows some traditionalist liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just  anfield   but the maths of modern-day football decree that multi-millions for stadium and team could ease the pain.  i would take £50m if we had no investment  but if we did  keep him. as for the stadium  if it gets us cash what difference does it make really   £50m for gerrard  i don t care who you are  the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. we cannot let that sum of money go  despite gerrard s quality.  through a cleverly worded statement  the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself  which i think is the right thing to do.  critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard. ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. i am hoping he doesn t walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash.  £50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad  however  if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it. i would however be happy with gerrard s transfer for any fee over £35m.  parry s statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. upping the ante is another smart move by parry.  i would keep gerrard. no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.  the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. clearly  if he isn t  then we would be foolish not to sell. the worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-champions league football.,0.14811611

713,entertainment,music man to the oscars bill conti s job of musical director of the oscars show is not for the faint-hearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate plate-spinning assignment.  this year marks conti s 17th turn at the helm of the academy awards orchestra.  the excitement is a live performance as a musician   he says.  all of your colleagues  everyone in the film industry is in the theatre. all the important people.  i guess it s just a television show but we always think it s a bit more.  the orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average oscars show. as well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage  it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house.   it s a very busy evening  it takes a certain amount of preparation of music  orchestrating  sketching rehearsing  before the show. but you don t know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director  it s exciting   explains conti. and much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed.  we don t know who the winners will be. so when they say   the winner is   we have five different pieces of music in front of us  they say the name  we play the appropriate one immediately   adds conti.  the orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches  despite being told to be brief by the show s producers.  the decision to drown out or  kill  the offending star with music is relayed from the director s box to the orchestra via conti s earpiece.  i don t feel good about it at all. it s not my call though   he says.  when the director says  music  the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall. we don t usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off.  the person that s been cut off  who s 10 feet from me  is glaring at me like it s death time.  on occasions  some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak.  julia roberts  when she came on  she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do   he says. conti received an oscar in 1983 for the original score of the right stuff. he also received two nominations in the original song category in 1976 for gonna fly now from rocky and in 1981 for the title song from for your eyes only.   it s a moment in the sun   he says.  when people get up there  some people  this is hard to believe  people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining  might get a little flustered.  but there s this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they re either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met.   the image of the oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories. behind the scenes  the key players  such as conti  have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with.  there s a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls. i can control hearing in my ears  the left ear or the right ear - different things at different times.   i have to communicate with the director. i have a little microphone that s attached to my headset. to open up that microphone  i have a footswitch   he explains. conti s most nerve-wracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director  in 1977  when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke. conti immediately told the show s director:  i start cursing and screaming  i tell him we re not going to die for this show - you must do something or i m going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we re going to be home in 10 minutes.   oh no bill don t do anything   came the response.  imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra  60 or so of them in the pit and while we re playing  firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke.  the smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands.  no one died  it s not a big story  but it was scary at the time   laughs conti. when the ceremony is over  the music director attends the annual governor s ball with his family.  i have a drink and relive the show   he says.  i m not for too much carousing. i go home and unwind. it takes me about a day.,-1.8375711

1334,politics,clarke defends terror detentions the home secretary has defended his decision not to release foreign terror suspects despite a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws.  house of lords law lords ruled against the detention measures last week. they said it was wrong to have one set of laws for foreign suspects and another for british suspects. new home secretary charles clarke said he would carefully consider the ruling and would return to parliament early in the new year with proposals.  he insisted that he would not be rushed into judgement but would examine the law lords  findings in detail.  my duty is to look at first of all the security of this country and in so doing to consider very carefully the precise legal measures that there are.  mr clarke s comments came in response to an emergency question from liberal democrat constitutional affairs spokesman david heath. mr heath said the judgement contained  unprecedented condemnation and could not have been more unequivocal . he said he accepted the difficult balance between the nation s security and human rights but questioned why the home office had made  no contingency plans for the present circumstances .   these detainees should be prosecuted and tried. simply renewing the present deeply unsatisfactory legislation is not an option.  shadow home secretary david davis said it was not possible to overstate the importance of the judgment and urged the government to move as fast as  competently possible  to sort the problem out in the interests of natural justice.  if you do  we will give you every support.  the law lords  ruling came on charles clarke s first day as home secretary last thursday following david blunkett s resignation. in a statement on the same day  mr clarke said:  i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year.  in the meantime  we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords.   but the government was widely criticised for insisting the detentions would continue following the ruling last week. lord bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions  in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status  by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects  but not britons. lord nicholls of birkenhead  in his ruling  said:  indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.  the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office s powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us.,0.9623642

1069,business,dollar drops on reserves concerns the us dollar has dropped against major currencies on concerns that central banks may cut the amount of dollars they hold in their foreign reserves.  comments by south korea s central bank at the end of last week have sparked the recent round of dollar declines. south korea  which has about $200bn in foreign reserves  said it plans instead to boost holdings of currencies such as the australian and canadian dollar. analysts reckon that other nations may follow suit and now ditch the dollar. at 1300 gmt  the euro was up 0.9% on the day at 1.3187 euros per us dollar. the british pound had added 0.5% to break through the $1.90 level  while the dollar had fallen by 1.3% against the japanese yen to trade at 104.16 yen.  at the start of the year  the us currency  which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows  staged something of a recovery.  analysts  however  pointed to the dollar s inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data  and highlighted the fact that many of the us s economic problems had not disappeared. the focus once again has been on the country s massive trade and budget deficits  with predictions of more dollar weakness to come.  the comments from korea came at a time when sentiment towards the dollar was already softening   said ian gunner  a trader at mellon financial. on tuesday  traders in asia said that both south korea and taiwan had withdrawn their bids to buy dollars at the start of the session. mansoor mohi-uddin  chief currency strategist at ubs  said that there was a sentiment in the market that  central banks from asia and the middle east are buying euros . a report last month already showed that the dollar was losing its allure as a currency that offered rock-steady returns and stability. compiled by central banking publications and sponsored by the uk s royal bank of scotland  the survey found 39 nations out of 65 questioned were increasing their euro holdings  with 29 cutting back on the us dollar.,2.3300533

1988,sport,wilkinson to miss ireland match england will have to take on ireland in the six nations without captain and goal-kicker jonny wilkinson  according to his newcastle boss rob andrew.  wilkinson - who had targeted the 27 february match for his international comeback - has been missed by england  not least for his goal-kicking.  jonny s not fit yet   falcons chief andrew told bbc radio five live.  he won t be fit for dublin  there s no doubt about that  but he might be fit for scotland and italy.  the 25-year-old has not played for england since the 2003 world cup final after a succession of injuries. england  who have lost three six nations games in a row  wasted a 17-6 half-time lead in their 18-17 defeat to france. goal-kickers charlie hodgson and olly barkley missed six penalty attempts and a drop-goal between them.  they ve probably got two of the best english kickers in the premiership in hodgson and barkley   added andrew  a former england fly-half and goal-kicker.   they re both pretty good kickers. charlie is a good kicker week-in  week-out.  but it s all about pressure and unfortunately england are just not handling the pressure at the moment.  andrew also blamed england s poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirements and injuries.  they just didn t have that leadership that would have seen them through. martin johnson  lawrence dallaglio and jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations   he said.  i think it is really difficult for jason robinson to lead the side effectively from full-back.  meanwhile  former england full-back dusty hare put england s mistakes down to a lack of mental toughness.   jonny wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an 80% kicking success rate   hare told bbc radio five live.  but natural-born toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do.  you have to be able to shut out all the outside elements and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts.  hodgson  who has an excellent kicking record with club side sale sharks  has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late.  the top golfers don t hit the fairway every time  and it is the same with goal-kicking   hare added.  you need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over  but great goal-kickers like jonny wilkinson come along very rarely.,-0.079889774
225,entertainment,fox  too reliant on reality tv  the head of us tv network fox has admitted the broadcaster had relied too heavily on reality tv shows such as the poor-rating who s your daddy.  chief executive gail berman said  in the case of this fall we drifted to too much on the unscripted side . the series who s your daddy  where a young woman tries to pick her natural father for a cash prize caused outrage from adoption groups and rated badly. last season  fox s prime-time audience fell by 600 000 to 5.9 million. ms berman said:  i think the audience expects loud things from fox. sometimes they work  and sometimes they don t.   who s your daddy  the first episode of which was shown on 3 january  pulled in a disappointing audience of 6.3 million  according to the nielsen ratings system. five other episodes of the show had also been filmed will be dropped from fox s schedules  ms berman said. she was predicting a drop in ratings even for some of the network s established reality shows  such as american idol  which is due to start its fourth series this week. fox had unveiled a new strategy last year promising to launch new shows every season  including the traditionally quiet summer season. though that had met with a poor reception  ms berman said  there s no question that the audience  in our mind  is ready  willing and able to accept new programming in the summer . fox has changed this plan  launching new shows in may instead of june. one of the new shows will be the animated series american dad  made by seth macfarlane  the creator of family guy. that series  after becoming a hit on dvd  is also set to return with new episodes.,-1.8516755
2080,politics,howard unveils tory asylum plans tory plans to cut immigration to the uk are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees  michael howard has said.  as his party set out detailed asylum reform plans  mr howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs. there would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. some charities say the plans would put refugees  lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled.  tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans.  by cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders  they will actually make the problem worse   said mr blair. liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick  fair and firm asylum system. but he said it was  absolutely disgusting  to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set.  in a speech in london on monday  mr howard said:  it s not racist  as some people to claim  to talk about controlling immigration far from it.  he said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that  firm but fair  immigration controls were essential for good community relations.    - withdrawing from the 1951 united nations convention on refugees  which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need  not numbers   - introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents   - detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the uk - a worry for  national security    - stop considering asylum applications inside the uk and instead take people from united nations refugee agency camps. anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin.     the tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an australian-style points system and those wanting to join families in the uk.  mr howard said nearly 160 000 people were settling in the uk every year - the size of a city like peterborough. the plans would help achieve a  substantial reduction  in immigration  he said  although he could not predict a figure. he said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current  unfair and inhumane  system.   we need to break the link between arriving in britain and claiming asylum   mr howard said.  by breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling.   but the un refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees. and a spokesman for european justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini said the plans would contravene eu asylum policy  which meant the uk could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. refugee council chief executive maeve sherlock called the plans  dangerous  ill thought-out and hugely irresponsible . lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled  she warned. commission for racial equality chairman trevor phillips said asylum applications were down 40% and economic migration down about 10%.  he did not think mr howard intended to centre the debate about race. but he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture. mr howard called that suggestion  disgraceful .,2.5468125
613,politics,student  fee factor  played down a rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in scotland.  however  lifelong learning minister jim wallace said that this would not result in scottish students missing out. applications from england and wales rose by 17% between january 2005 and the previous year  up 23 600 to 27 700. fears had been expressed that a flood of  fee refugees  would try to avoid top-up fees of up to £3 000 a year being introduced in england. in june last year  mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by £2 000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood  although no figure has yet been agreed. legislation to introduce the top-up fees in england is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all.  the figures were made public on thursday by admissions service ucas. universities scotland  which represents university principals  claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to scottish students being squeezed out. director  david caldwell  said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities  but this was not a major factor. he told bbc radio scotland s good morning scotland programme:  the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality  they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study.   they know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in england and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to scotland are so inflated.  however  it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from england studying here.  mr wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context. he explained that when applications were translated into acceptances  the number was not huge - an additional figure of about 200.  also  the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from wales  where there are no plans for top-up fees  have also risen  by 19%. mr wallace said:  accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which scottish higher education is held  not just in britain.  we want to make sure that when students are making their choice  they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to scotland.  we do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for scottish students to get places at scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option.  very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students.,0.8656688
1454,tech,can yahoo dominate next decade  yahoo has reached the grand old age of 10 and  in internet years  that is a long time.  for many  yahoo remains synonymous with the internet - a veteran that managed to ride the dot-com wave and the subsequent crash and maintain itself as one of the web s top brands. but for others there is another  newer net icon threatening to overshadow yahoo in the post dot-com world - google.  the veteran and the upstart have plenty in common - yahoo was the first internet firm to offer initial public shares and google was arguably the most watched ipo (initial public offering) of the post-dot-com era. both began life as search engines although in 2000  when yahoo chose google to power its search facility while it concentrated on its web portal business  it was very much yahoo that commanded press attention. in recent years  the column inches have stacked up in google s favour as the search engine also diversifies with the launch of services such as gmail  its shopping channel froogle and google news.  for jupiter analyst olivier beauvillain  yahoo s initial decision to put its investment on search on hold was an error.  yahoo was busy building a portal and while it was good to diversify they made a big mistake in outsourcing search to google   he said  they thought google would just be a technology provider but it has become a portal in its own right and a direct competitor   he added. he believes yahoo failed to see how crucial search would become to internet users  something it has rediscovered in recent years.  it is interesting that in these last few years  it has refocused on search following the success of google   he said. but for allen weiner  a research director at analyst firm gartner and someone who has followed yahoo s progress since the early years  the future of search is not going to be purely about the technology powering it.  search technology is valuable but the next generation of search is going to be about premium content and the interface that users have to that content   he said. he believes the rivalry between google and yahoo is overblown and instead thinks the real battle is going to be between yahoo and msn. it is a battle that yahoo is currently winning  he believes.  microsoft has amazing assets including software capability and a global name but it has yet to show me it can create a rival product to yahoo   he said.  he is convinced yahoo remains the single most important brand on the world wide web.   i believe yahoo is the seminal brand on the web. if you are looking for a text book definition of web portal then yahoo is it   he said. it has achieved this dominance  mr weiner believes  by a canny combination of acquisitions such as that of inktomi and overture  and by avoiding direct involvement in either content creation or internet access. that is not to say that yahoo hasn t had its dark days. when the dot-com bubble burst  it lost one-third of its revenue in a single year  bore a succession of losses and saw its market value fall from a peak of $120bn to $4.6bn at one point. crucial to its survival was the decision to replace chief executive tim koogle with terry semel in may 2001  thinks mr weiner. his business savvy  coupled with the technical genius of founder jerry yang has proved a winning combination  he says.  so as the internet giant emerges from its first decade as a survivor  how will it fare as it enters its teenage years   the game is theirs to lose and msn is the only one that stands in the way of yahoo s domination   predicted mr weiner. nick hazel  yahoo s head of consumer services in the uk  thinks the fact that yahoo has grown up with the first wave of the internet generation will stand it in good stead. search will be a key focus as will making yahoo messenger available on mobiles  forging new broadband partnerships such as that with bt in the uk and continuing to provide a range of services beyond the desktop  he says. mr weiner thinks yahoo s vision of becoming the ultimate gateway to the web will move increasing towards movies and television as more and more people get broadband access.  it will spread its portal wings to expand into rich media   he predicts.,0.5796747

399,politics,lib dems   bold  election policy charles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an  honest choice  at the next general election.  with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes  mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation. it is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the lib dems and the other two. with his party s previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government  he has switched tack. now he is promising to levy a  modest  increase of the same amount on earnings over £100 000 a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges. they are to scrap student fees  finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. that last policy will also see about 3% of the most well off paying more while others  pensioners in particular  will pay less.  labour and the tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed.  inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services. the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through £35bn efficiency savings  while labour has offered £22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals  although there is little chance they will propose increases. in many ways the argument between the lib dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between labour and the tories in the 1980s and early 1990s. but  unlike the old tory-labour debate  he believes voters are ready to see  modest  tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services. that is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts.  similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration  with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not  foment an artificial debate  about immigration and attacking michael howard s proposals for quotas. once again  with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration  mr kennedy is stressing the different  more liberal approach of his party. mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party s election chances  declaring the tories were not going to be  significant players  in the poll. he repeated his pledge not to do post-election deals with either party after the election. mr kennedy went on to suggest the re-election of a labour government with a small majority would amount to a  massive vote of no confidence   in tony blair s government. that suggests the lib dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful  even pivotal position in a vastly different house of commons after the next election. it is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before.,2.004421
2063,sport,campbell rescues arsenal sol campbell proved to be an unlikely match-winner to earn arsenal a hard-fought win at portsmouth.  the england defender lashed home a 25-yard shot for his first goal in 16 months to take arsenal back into second spot  five points behind chelsea. but before campbell scored the best two chances of the game fell to pompey striker ricardo fuller. in the first half he blasted wide when clear  and his control let him down in the second half when well placed. portsmouth got plenty of bodies behind the ball to deny arsenal space in the early stages. but their marking was slack at a corner and patrick vieira should have done better when the ball fell to him 16 yards out. a mistake by arjan de zeeuw let thierry henry in behind the pompey defence on 17 minutes but as he bore down on goal linvoy primus got in a saving tackle. with just fuller as an out-and-out striker  portsmouth s shape made life difficult for arsenal. but a delightful touch by robin van persie gave henry a sight of goal  although the angle was too tight for his shot to trouble jamie ashdown.  ashdown caused hearts to flutter on 28 minutes when he missed his punch at a corner and kolo toure headed just wide and  as arsenal began to press  van persie blasted over a good opportunity after henry had set him up. henry took a quick return pass from vieira but ashdown was out quickly to block  and there were some anxious seconds for pompey as the ball ran loose before matthew taylor cleared. after playing second fiddle  portsmouth should have taken the lead on 34 minutes. referee howard webb played a good advantage to allow steve stone to send gary o neil away but  having shrugged off toure  the pompey midfielder planted his shot wide from 10 yards. as half-time approached  henry teased a shot through a ruck of players and inches wide. at the other end  fuller broke clear but failed to hit the target as toure closed him down.  fuller was given the best chance of the match so far on 48 minutes when patrik berger s break and slipped pass played him clear. but a poor first touch lost him the opportunity and even when he checked back and went down under vieira s challenge  referee webb was not interested. fuller paid the price when he gave way on 55 minutes to aiyegbeni yakubu  who returned after six weeks out with a knee injury. but it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from ashdown to cling on to van persie s shot as henry sniffed for scraps.  portsmouth were growing in confidence and keeper manuel almunia had to stand his ground to beat away a powerful shot from berger. arsenal were struggling to find their rhythm but took the lead through the unlikely source of campbell. the england defender needed little invitation as pompey backed off to stride forward and lash a ferocious shot past ashdown. arsenal might have stretched their lead two minutes later when mathieu flamini escaped his marker to flash a header wide from henry s free-kick. almunia went full length to grab berger s long-range shot  while ashdown palmed away substitute dennis bergkamp s shot.  ashdown  griffin  de zeeuw  primus  taylor  stone  o neil  faye (berkovic 83)  berger  lualua  fuller (yakubu 55).  subs not used: hislop  quashie  cisse.  almunia  lauren  toure  campbell  cole  pires  flamini  vieira  clichy  van persie (bergkamp 68)  henry.  subs not used: lehmann  fabregas  senderos  hoyte.  cole.  campbell 75.  20 170.  h webb (s yorkshire).,2.324603

1424,sport,can smith work scottish wonders  the worst kept secret in scottish football was revealed on thursday when walter smith was named as the new national manager.  from the moment berti vogts  miserable tenure in charge of scotland ended  the former rangers and everton boss has been the overwhelming favourite for the post. but is smith the man for what must be one of the hardest jobs in football  the 56-year-old takes over at a time when the national side is in the doldrums. scotland have not reached a major finals since the world cup in 1998 and reaching germany 2006 looks near impossible  having picked up just two points from the opening three games in the qualifying race. and the fifa rankings see scotland listed at an all time low of 77th  below the likes of estonia  ghana  angola and thailand. scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level  so smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources. smith s track record make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game. the man who was alex ferguson s assistant when scotland played at the 1986 world cup won seven league titles with rangers. and his appointment has been widely endorsed by many of the games  top names  including ferguson and graeme souness  who took him to ibrox as his assistant in 1986. characters like souness  ferguson and current ibrox manager alex mcleish all cite smith s experience and his expansive knowledge of the scottish game.  much was made of vogts  inability to express himself to the players and media. that will certainly not be the case with smith. the former dundee united and dumbarton full-back is from the managerial old school - straight talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better (often with the use of some colourful invective). but it should be remembered vogts came to scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae - a world cup winner as a player and a european championships winner as a manager. smith will inherit the same problems vogts had - a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents. and it remains to be seen if smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted so much of vogts  preparation work. a fresh start for the scottish national team was imperative and smith is widely regarded as a safe pair of hands. but will a safe pair of hands be enough when the adroit hands of a magician might be required...,0.05581045
553,tech,games win for blu-ray dvd format the next-generation dvd format blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival  according to its backers.  blu-ray  backed by 100 firms including sony  is competing against toshiba and nec-backed hd-dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games. the blu-ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format. the next generation of dvds will hold high-definition video and sound. this offers incredible 3d-like quality of pictures which major hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year. in a separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas  toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005.   as we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images  we have a much greater need for storage   richard doherty  from panasonic s hollywood laboratories  one of the pioneers of blu-ray  told the bbc news website.  so by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today s dvd.  a blu-ray disc will be able to store 50gb of high-quality data  while toshiba s hd-dvd will hold 30gb. mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs  including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders. both toshiba and blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war  akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the 1980s  can be resolved over the next year when next-generation dvd players start to come out. when players do come out  they will be able to play standard dvds too  which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current dvds.  but the support from vivendi and electronics arts is a big boost to blu-ray in the battle for supremacy.  gaming is a $20 billion industry worldwide  so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made.  the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies   said michael heilmann  chief technology officer for vivendi universal.  blu-ray offers the capacity  performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming.  ea  a leading games developer and publisher  added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and blu-ray had the capacity  functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations. mr doherty said gamers were  ravenous  for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles.  gamers  especially those working on pcs  are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures  deeper levels  for delivering higher-resolution playback.   he added:  the focus for games moving forward on increased immersion.   gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated 3d models and textures and increasing the resolution  increasing the frame rate - all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience.  fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost. as games move to more photo-real capability  the current technology is limiting.  they are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments   said mr doherty. currently  graphics-intensive pc games also require multiple discs for installation. high-definition dvds will cut down on that need. likewise  consoles rely on single discs  so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better  high-resolution games. blu-ray has already won backing from major hollywood studios  such as mgm studios  disney  and buena vista  as well as top technology firms like dell  lg  samsung and phillips amongst others. while toshiba s hd-dvd technology has won backing from paramount  universal and warner bros.  the real world benefits (of hd-dvd) are apparent and obvious   said jim cardwell  president of warner home video. mr cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with hd-dvd. both formats are courting microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation xbox  but discussions are still on-going. next generation dvds will also be able to store images and other data. ces is the largest consumer electronics show in the world  and runs from 6 to 9 january.,-0.39717484
2024,politics,blair blasts tory spending plans tony blair has launched an attack on conservative spending plans  saying they are a  ludicrous improbability .  the prime minister has told a labour party gathering that the tory policies would cause economic failure. tory leader michael howard has said his party would cut £35bn in  wasteful  spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts. on saturday  tory shadow home secretary david davis said the tories would fund the cuts by removing  inefficiencies  which had  burgeoned  under labour. in his speech  mr blair contrasted a reformed labour party  which had learned to occupy the political centre ground  with a hidebound tory party  which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. mr blair said:  the conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk  both britain s hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages  inflation  unemployment  for decades - and the key investment in public services.   i believe that the tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it s possible to imagine   he said.  it s a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of conservative government.  mr blair added:  they  the conservatives have learned nothing.  by contrast  he said  new labour had listened to its electorate and changed.  mr blair went on to list his government s achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party.  so now we have a choice  we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. and i say we have to fight.  in response  david davis said the tories would make cuts  such as removing regional assemblies  but would bring in more police officers and match labour s spending on health and education.  everybody knows  having lived through this government the last seven years  that they faced lots of stealth tactics  lots of increases in taxes  but no improvement in public services   he said. mr davis said labour had been responsible for  huge waste  huge overspending  not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy .  the public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government  less waste and lower taxes with a tory government   he concluded.  gordon brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. the chancellor said the conservatives  plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011  which the tories deny. mr brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be  distracted or diverted . according to an advance text released by officials  he told delegates:  we must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.   mr brown warned that the tories were planning  the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto . meanwhile  tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin accused mr blair of  misrepresenting  the party s proposals and questioned how labour would fund its own plans.  he still cannot accept the simple truth  which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools  hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes   mr letwin said.  once again mr blair and his chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans,2.4335263

897,politics,lib dems target the student vote students can decide the fate of mps in some seats at the next election  liberal democrat leader charles kennedy has claimed.  the party says the votes of students can win it 27 new seats at the poll. the figures assume all students will vote in their university town. in fact  some may vote where the parents live. the lib dems say scrapping university fees wins them student support. but the tories would also end fees and labour says both would cap people s ambitions.  the lib dems have named the 14 seats where there are enough students to take the lib dems from second place to beat labour  and the 13 where they could go from second to beat the tories. launching his campaign to win students  votes at the london school of economics  mr kennedy urged students to  make their mark . he underlined lib dem plans to scrap university fees and reintroduce maintenance grants of up to £2 000. he said:  top-up fees put students off university  especially those from a poorer background.  and is it really right that so many young people are starting out in life with mortgage-style debts hanging round their necks   mr kennedy also said students want action on the environment and see the iraq war  which his party opposed  as a defining issue.  labour has pushed through plans to let universities charge fees of up to £3 000 a year  with the poorest students eligible for non-repayable support of up to £3 000. ahead of mr kennedy s launch  a labour spokesperson said:  like the tories  the liberal democrats would restrict access to higher education and put a cap on aspiration  closing the door to students with good grades and restricting their life ambitions.  they are committed to abandoning labour s targets of getting 50% of 18 to 30-year-olds going into higher education and under lib dem plans students would even have to study near home.  the conservatives say they would abolish university tuition fees and instead offer large student loans at commercial rates of interest.  they say the lib dem policy would leave universities wholly dependent for their income on the  goodwill  of the chancellor.  shadow education secretary tim collins is on thursday setting out a new scheme of vocational grants for 14 to 16-year-olds to tackle what he says are  crippling skills shortages . the lib dem analysis of the difference students could make to its election chances is based on all students being registered to vote near their university  not in their home towns. although the expected 5 may election would be during term time  students can vote by post. the electoral commission and national union of students are worried students in halls of residence can find it hard to register to vote. some hall wardens are reluctant to register students because of data protection fears - but students can get themselves registered. if the election is on 5 may  voters need to register by 11 march.    - the seats where the lib dems say student votes can swing the election for them are: bristol west  cardiff central  leeds north west  cambridge  manchester gorton  sheffield central  oxford east  newcastle-upon-tyne central  liverpool riverside  holborn and st pancras  oldham east and saddleworth  manchester withington  islington south and finsbury  birmingham yardley  surrey south west  taunton  orpington  haltemprice and howden  eastbourne  isle of wight  dorset west  bournemouth east  wells  canterbury  cities of london and westminster  bournemouth west  westmorland and lonsdale.,2.7432292

2201,business,ban on forced retirement under 65 employers will no longer be able to force workers to retire before 65  unless they can justify it.  the government has announced that firms will be barred from 2006 from imposing arbitrary retirement ages. under new european age discrimination rules  a default retirement age of 65 will be introduced. workers will be permitted to request staying on beyond this compulsory retirement age  although employers will have the right to refuse. trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt said people would not be forced to work longer than they wanted  saying the default age was not a statutory  compulsory retirement age. she said employers would be free to continue employing people for as long as they were competent.  under age discrimination proposals from the department of trade and industry last year workers were to be allowed to work on till 70 if they wished.  business leaders had opposed the plan as they said it would be too costly and cumbersome. the british chambers of commerce welcomed the latest proposal.  this move today is the best of both worlds   it said.  employers have the ability to define the end point of the employer-employee relationship and employees have flexibility with a right to request to work past the age of 65.  but age concern said imposing a retirement age of 65 was  cowardly  and a  complete u-turn .  this makes a mockery of the government s so-called commitment to outlawing ageism  leaving the incoming age discrimination law to unravel   said gordon lishman  director general of age concern england .  it is now inevitable that older people will mount legal challenges to the decision using european law.  the decision will have no impact on the age at which workers can collect their state pension  the government has said.,-1.9296584
1045,sport,italy 17-28 ireland two moments of magic from brian o driscoll guided ireland to a workmanlike victory against italy.  a pair of classic outside breaks from the ireland captain set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer. italy led 9-8 early in the second half but stringer s try gave ireland a lead they never lost. the hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through ludovico nitoglia  but denis hickie s try ensured an irish victory. italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a luciano orquera penalty after seven minutes.  it could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with a ronan o gara penalty midway through the first half. the italians were driving at the heart of the irish defence and  for the first quarter  the irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs.  when they finally did  just before the half-hour mark  o driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for murphy. the ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving murphy in at the corner. o gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera  and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge italy into a 9-8 lead.  the only ireland player offering a real threat was o driscoll  and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. shane horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and stringer scooted over  with o gara landing the tricky conversion. a penalty apiece saw ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter  but they were lucky to survive when italy launched a series of attacks. winger nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul.  an o gara penalty put ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for a converted try. o driscoll limped off late on  joining centre partner gordon d arcy on the sidelines  and the final word went to italy. prop martin castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an italian pack which had kept the irish under pressure throughout.  de marigny; mi bergamasco  canale  masi  nitoglia; orquera  troncon; lo cicero  ongaro  castrogiovanni; dellape  bortolami; persico  ma bergamasco  parisse.  perugini  intoppa  del fava  dal maso  griffen  pozzebon  robertson.  murphy  horgan  o driscoll  d arcy  hickie  o gara  stringer  corrigan  byrne  hayes  o kelly  o connell  s easterby  leamy  foley.  sheahan  horan  o callaghan  miller  g easterby  humphreys  dempsey.  p o brien (new zealand),-1.3644538
1373,business,uk economy facing  major risks  the uk manufacturing sector will continue to face  serious challenges  over the next two years  the british chamber of commerce (bcc) has said.  the group s quarterly survey of companies found exports had picked up in the last three months of 2004 to their best levels in eight years. the rise came despite exchange rates being cited as a major concern. however  the bcc found the whole uk economy still faced  major risks  and warned that growth is set to slow. it recently forecast economic growth will slow from more than 3% in 2004 to a little below 2.5% in both 2005 and 2006.  manufacturers  domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter  the survey of 5 196 firms found. employment in manufacturing also fell and job expectations were at their lowest level for a year.   despite some positive news for the export sector  there are worrying signs for manufacturing   the bcc said.  these results reinforce our concern over the sector s persistent inability to sustain recovery.  the outlook for the service sector was  uncertain  despite an increase in exports and orders over the quarter  the bcc noted.  the bcc found confidence increased in the quarter across both the manufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the levels at the start of 2004. the reduced threat of interest rate increases had contributed to improved confidence  it said. the bank of england raised interest rates five times between november 2003 and august last year. but rates have been kept on hold since then amid signs of falling consumer confidence and a slowdown in output.  the pressure on costs and margins  the relentless increase in regulations  and the threat of higher taxes remain serious problems   bcc director general david frost said.  while consumer spending is set to decelerate significantly over the next 12-18 months  it is unlikely that investment and exports will rise sufficiently strongly to pick up the slack.,1.7341151

1882,business,indian oil firm eyes yukos assets india s biggest oil exploration firm  oil & natural gas corp (ongc)  says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled russian crude producer yukos.   we are in touch with the concerned russian entities about the yukos assets and other opportunities in russia   said ongc chairman subir raha. local press had reported that ongc was looking to buy 15% of yukos  former key oil production unit for $2bn (£1bn). yukos is being broken up by russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill.  it was forced to sell its key production unit yuganskneftegas (yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $27bn in unpaid taxes and fines.  state-owned rosneft now owns yugansk and russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. indian oil minister mani shankar aiyar discussed ongc s plans during a trip to moscow last year  and the topic came up again during russian president vladimir putin s recent visit to new delhi.  it would make great sense for us to build on that   said mr aiyar. india s oil production has stagnated over recent years  and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. india imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. at the same time  india s economy is booming and the country s thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.  india produces about 793 000 barrels of oil per day (bpd)  little changed since the start of the 1990s  according to oil industry analysts douglas-westwood. consumption  meanwhile  has jumped to 2.4 million bpd  compared with 474 000 bpd in 1973.   for countries to develop  they have to have access to energy   said john westwood  managing director of oil industry analysts douglas-westwood. india is a  dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil . by buying into yugansk  ongc would be able to reduce its dependence on gulf states for oil imports  mr westwood explained  especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within india are slim.  we forecast that indian production will go into significant decline   mr westwood said.  by 2020  production may only be at half of today s levels.  ongc  which is majority-owned by the indian state  already has bought petroleum assets in countries including vietnam  sudan and russia. the company is a partner with rosneft in the sakhalin-1 oil field off russia s siberian coast.  ongc is  however  not the only firm interested in yugansk.  chinese crude company china national petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor  while on thursday  italy refused to rule out an interest. ongc s interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world s biggest oil producers brought to its knees. the dispute is partly driven by president putin s clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky  who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. yukos has been battling the russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us. analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without yugansk. on thursday  a us court said it will hear arguments for yukos  bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 february. should that happen  yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets  analysts said.,0.77474165

1458,politics,what the election should really be about  a general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy. here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected spring poll.  we ve called for the state pension to be increased from £79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of £105.45. that s what we re calling for. many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system. if we ve got one in five pensioners below the poverty line  we ve got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty.  we ve drawn up a pensioners  manifesto. this will be sent to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies. they will be asked which of the top five issues  including the pension issue  they would support. once we ve got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well. it s our way of putting the politicians on notice. we are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country  they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters. before 1997 most pensioners voted conservative. in 1997 and 2001 they voted labour. but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around. they cannot take that vote for granted.  pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turner s full report into the issue. he said the uk had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world.  that the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment.  we haven t worked out specific plans but i imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent mps. various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing. we don t have any large demonstrations planned but they can t be ruled out.  it is hard to say whether we will be successful. we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent  but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq.  repealing the hunting bill.  we are challenging the use of the parliament act 1949 in a high court action. we are hoping to hear in the new year. whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time. when the ban comes into force on 18 february we will be going to the european court because no compensation is being paid. so there s a lot of legal territory to go. we are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking. whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is. (rural affairs minister) alun michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult. it is not intimidatory - on the whole it is groups of angry housewives. of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything.  it will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election tony blair will ever face. it s exactly what the prime minister did not want. he wanted the issue off the table until after the election.  people using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad. the reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting. it is another sort of form of shooting for sport. the principle is the same whether it s a tiger or a pheasant.  we will widely publicise what s happening in relation to trophy hunting. we will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the uk. we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and would-be mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports. we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors. with hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against it.  i think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda. whether or not we will get a ban i am not sure. but it will mobilise public opinion. everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban.  the issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice. the language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum. choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade. it s become an issue in itself but what s really missing from the debate is the consumer s choice in that. choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools. we have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there s a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that. we want choice on the consumer s terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice.  firstly  we have our website. it features our campaigns and changes every day. secondly through our 700 000 members who communicate with us. thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a pre-election conference. we will invite the opinion formers  mps  journalists and others. the idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians.  i think we will be successful. it s very much the language being used by the main political parties. politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue.  fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers. we have been hearing about this proposed increase of 1.92p per litre that gordon brown has been postponing and postponing. tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that s an increase of about £750. if you re running 10 vehicles it s obviously 10 times that.  if fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified. there will be a huge effect throughout the industry and i would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations. what it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business.  we will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press. regrettably it s one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press. whatever we do  the public don t like lorries - they see us as a complaining minority. but they don t realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work  when you see a lorry it s already at work.,-1.4987416
493,politics,brown outlines third term vision gordon brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of new labour s next general election bid.  he said ensuring every child in britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the nhs s creation. the chancellor has previously planned the party s election strategy but this time the role will be filled by alan milburn - a key ally of tony blair. the premier insisted mr brown will have a key role in labour s campaign  and praised his handling of the economy.  writing in the guardian newspaper  mr brown outlined his view of the direction new labour should be taking.  as our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear  labour s ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance  disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education  good health and sustainable communities.  bbc political editor andrew marr said that mr brown s article was  a warning shot  to mr blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process.  it was  as always  coded and careful... but entirely deliberate   was mr marr s assessment. the prime minister was asked about mr brown s article and about his election role when he appeared on bbc radio 4 s today programme. mr blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor s role would be  central . mr blair argued that under new labour the country had changed for the better and that was  in part  because of mr brown s management of the economy. and he pledged childcare would be a  centrepiece  of labour s manifesto. he also predicted the next general election will be a  tough  tough fight  for new labour. but the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 may. mr blair said he was taking  nothing for granted  ahead of the vote - warning that the tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut labour s majority instead of hoping for an outright win.,4.443736
1630,politics,ukip mep attacked german  empire  a uk independence party mep suggested germany saw the eu as an  empire  and was cheaper than using tanks  a new documentary has revealed. mike nattrass  ukip s deputy leader  made the comments to an audience at a meeting during last september s hartlepool by-election campaign. but challenged on the remark  he denied accusing germany of using the eu as cover for a  4th german reich . he says he was not  german-bashing  but saying peace was the eu s founding aim. the meeting was shown in a bbc 3 film on ex-ukip mep robert kilroy-silk. the former chat show host quit the party earlier this month  calling it a joke.  the documentary showed mr nattrass  apparently talking about the eu  telling the meeting:  the germans are the big losers here but they don t care because to them the project is worthwhile.  it s like an empire for them spreading in all directions away from germany into hungary  into what they call the sudetenland - czechoslovakia  places like that.  so it s cheaper for them to do it this way than roll the tanks in.  on tuesday  he told the bbc news website he did not think the comments were offensive and worked happily with meps of different nationalities in the european parliament. he argued that peace was the only reason for having the  outdated  eu as there was no economic justification. pointing to germany s trade interests as a country in the centre of europe  mr nattrass said:  the fact is that the eu benefits germany but it does not benefit britain.  i m not at all german-bashing. it s the truth.  a ukip spokesman said:  mike has some passionate beliefs and sometimes uses excessively colourful language with which to express them.   the documentary showed some of the tensions between mr kilroy-silk and his fellow meps after ukip took third place in last year s european elections. he denied wanting to be leader until october 2004  when he told bbc one s breakfast with frost programme he aspired to the job. asked by the documentary makers why he had lied about his leadership ambitions  mr kilroy-silk said:  there was one thing i said that i shouldn t have said at the time.  i was trying to be helpful to the party and it was the wrong thing to do  i should have told the truth.  the film also included footage of a row between mr kilroy-silk  mep nigel farage and party leader roger knapman about rumours that he was about to resign the ukip whip in the european parliament. mr kilroy-silk told them he had not left the ukip group - a move he announced shortly after the meeting. he told mr farage:  don t tell lies nigel  now you ve told too many. most of the trouble had been caused by you.  ukip officials claim it was in fact mr kilroy-silk  not mr farage  who briefed newspapers he was leaving the group of meps.  later in unguarded  off-air comments in a television studio  mr kilroy-silk was heard saying he was irritated by  defending some of these right-wing fascist nutters . mr kilroy-silk separately said he had argued against ukip working with such groups which believed homosexuality was a sin. a ukip spokesman said there were more than 40 meps in the same group in the european parliament. they were from a broad spectrum - some right-wing  some left-wing - but with a shared belief in the  unfeasibility of the eu as it is now . he did not defend other groups  religious beliefs but argued it was their right to hold such views - just as mr kilroy-silk had a right to criticise arab states. london ukip mep gerard batten said:  robert has made a variety of comments about ukip and its meps.  there are of course two sides to every story. what robert does not say is that he was offered several positions which would have given him effective control of the party  but not the title of leader.  mr kilroy-silk is to launch his own parry  veritas  in westminster on wednesday.,1.5897424

1857,politics,parliament s record of scandal in a locked room at the heart of parliament there is a hive of scandal.  sex  betrayal and custody of children are all there in this affair but this time it has nothing to do with the recent troubles of david blunkett or boris johnson.  few realise that westminster in effect has its own divorce den. for sprinkled among 12 floors of archives are blow-by-blow accounts of marital break-ups - and now you can search what s there online. until 1857  the only way in england to get a full divorce which allowed re-marriage was to obtain an act of parliament by proving adultery or life-threatening cruelty. the legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings  dating back to 1670  all recorded among the 325 000 items which fill the 12 floors of the parliamentary archives in parliament s victoria tower. most people researching their family history want to discover some tale of illicit love. this gives them the chance.  divorce by parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids  butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses. among the records is the story of jane campbell  the first woman ever to divorce her husband. that happened in 1801 after she had discovered her husband  edward addison  had committed adultery with her sister jessy.  a transcript of evidence from jessy s maid  amelia laugher  shows her telling how addison frequently passed by her on the way to the room where she had just put her mistress naked to bed. it must have been a killer blow to addison s case - he had already fled abroad rather than pay the £5 000 damages ordered by a civil court. as well as making divorce history  jane campbell won custody of her children - unusual for a woman at the time. but divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and parliament.  there are the protestation returns from 1642 - lists of the protestants who pledged to  maintain the true reformed protestant religion . there are details of foreign nationals made british citizens by act of parliament  including composer george frideric handel in 1727. and the mass of private bills which  for example authorise the building of railways and roads  contain both the names and addresses of those involved and testimonies giving people a unique perspective on how their ancestors opposed them.  tax bills may be an extra source for pedigree hunters - the longest stretches for about 300m and is longer than the palace of westminster itself  listing the names of appointed tax collectors. this wealth of material has long been open to the public at the house of lords record office  with visitors able to phone ahead when they want to view particular items in the search room. but now five years of work has produced an online catalogue. david prior  assistant clerk of the archives  says the catalogue opens up new possibilities for research.  before  you just could not do it  you faced trawling through pages and pages of printed material   he says. mr prior sees the changes as part of a wider revolution in archives generally.  the archive profession may look fairly staid but is in an enormous period of change  mainly motivated by the potential of it  which is opening up all sorts of vistas for us   he says.  the archives do  of course  hold records of high (and low) politics too for both houses of parliament  including copies of all acts passed since 1497 - the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in norfolk. records for the commons only date back to 1834 - anything earlier was wiped out by the fire which destroyed most of the parliament buildings in 1834.  but that still leaves some of the most important documents of uk political history - parts of the bill of rights from 1689  the death warrant for charles i  the private papers and diaries of major politicians such as david lloyd george and andrew bonar law. there is also the 1606 act establishing 5 november as a thanksgiving day - the year after the gunpowder plot. that document is likely to feature in the exhibition the archives will put on next year as part of a series of events across london to mark the 400th anniversary of guy fawkes  conspiracy. as mr prior remarks as we walk by shelf after shelf of vellum (parchment made from goat s skin):  all human life is here.,-3.7862806

2076,tech,looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales  according to research from technology analysts gartner.  more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally  said the report  the highest total sold to date. the figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions  gartner said. good design and the look of a mobile  as well as new services such as music downloads  could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005  said analysts. although people were still looking for better replacement phones  there was evidence  according to gartner  that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales.   all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe   mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website.  japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years  time.  they already have tv  music  ringtones  cameras  and all that we can think of on mobiles  so people have stopped buying replacement phones.   but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too  according to gartner  as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade  said gartner. third generation mobiles (3g) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer  like video  could drive people into upgrading their phones  but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen.  at the end of the day  people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don t really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical.  nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms.  more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics  as well as music services. the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005  she added. this was not a  women s thing   she said  but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. it was not just about how the phone functioned  but about what it said about its owner.  western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design   said ms milanesi.   people are after something that is nice-looking  and together with that  there is the entertainment side.  this year music will have a part to play in this.  the market for full-track music downloads was worth just $20 million (£10.5 million) in 2004  but is set to be worth $1.8 billion (£9.4 million) by 2009  according to jupiter research. sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone  the w800  which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours  battery life  and a two megapixel camera. in july last year  motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones. apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola s standard music application for its music phones. but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod. ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity  which would not put too much strain on battery life.,1.1175933
43,sport,disappointed scott in solid start allan scott is confident of winning a medal at next week s european indoor championships after a solid debut on the international circuit.  the 22-year-old scot finished fourth in the 60m hurdles at the jose m cagigal memorial meeting in madrid.  it was definitely a learning curve and i certainly haven t ruled out challenging for a medal next week   said the east kilbride athlete. the race was won by felipe vivancos  who equalled the spanish record.  sweden s robert kronberg was second  with haiti s dudley dorival in third. scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final. he won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first iaaf indoor grand prix circuit final.  i should have done better than that   he said.  i felt i could have won it. i got a poor start - but i still felt i should have ran faster.  vivancos slashed his personal best to equal the spanish record with a time of 7.60secs while kronberg and dorival clocked 7.62secs and 7.63secs respectively.,1.2682548
97,sport,ireland win eclipses refereeing  errors  the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly-up.  it may have to go the whole way and have nfl-style video cameras all over the field  or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles. what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself. sunday s explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since 1948. the game was as exciting as it comes  with a much-improved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way. one can understand that frustration. there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory  but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport s  blazers . referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece. i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made. after all  he has no public recourse to criticism.  it was the same for simon mcdowell  the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france. as far as england were concerned  there were queries over mark cueto s first half-effort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick.  england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup. on that occasion  david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe  who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out. but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies. perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end.  lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control. however  one has to credit ireland flanker johnny o connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown. but in rugby  everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes. the referee also missed england s danny grewcock taking out ronan o gara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line. those were the stand-out moments in a classic game between the two old foes.  but there were many more  and one should not take away from those. brian o driscoll s winning try was as well-conceived as they come  while charlie hodgson s brilliant kicking display was another highlight. and ronan o gara s tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component. but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes. two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on. the first was denis hickie s brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner. he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson cross-field kick  then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try. ireland s second-row colossus paul o connell was equally superb. england had turned ireland one way then the other  and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating. england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers. unfortunately he ran into o connell who hit him hard - very hard - and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover. that spoke volumes about ireland s back-foot display  with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end. to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward. it may be tries that win games  but it is defence that wins championships.,0.8827739
2021,entertainment,stern dropped from radio stations controversial dj howard stern has been dropped from four us radio stations because he keeps promoting his move to a network broadcasting on satellite.  cidatel broadcasting said stern had transformed his show into a  continuous infomercial promoting sirius  his new satellite radio employer . stern will join the sirius subscription service  which is not governed by us regulators  next year. citadel pulled stern s show from stations in new york and pennsylvania. stern had been holiday for two weeks but his show did not return to the four stations as expected on 3 january. citadel said it did not yet know whether it would return to its network.  stern announced in october that he was leaving conventional radio  where his syndicated show goes out across the us  for the relatively restriction-free satellite service. the dj s broadcasts are well known for landing in trouble with regulators for obscene and sexually explicit rantings. stern was dropped by six stations owned by media giant clear channel in 2004 after it had to pay the federal communications commission $1.75m (£950 000)  over breaches indecency laws. media giant viacom has also reportedly agreed to the fcc s demands that if stern is issued with another indecency violation then his show must be pulled from all of its stations. viacom has also been hit with record fines of $3.5m (£1.8m) over stern and two other new york djs. but stern continues to be one of the most popular talk show hosts  particularly in the 25-54 age category.,-4.1614113
609,sport,england given tough sevens draw england will have to negotiate their way through a tough draw if they are to win the rugby world cup sevens in hong kong next month.  the second seeds have been drawn against samoa  france  italy  georgia and chinese taipei. the top two sides in each pool qualify but england could face 2001 winners new zealand in the quarter-finals if they stumble against samoa. scotland and ireland are in pool a together with the all blacks. england won the first event of the international rugby board world sevens series in dubai but have slipped to fourth in the table after failing to build on that victory.  however  they beat samoa in the recent los angeles sevens before losing to argentina in the semi-finals.  england have the ability and determination to win this world cup and create sporting history by being the only nation to hold both the 15s and sevens world cups at the same time   said england sevens coach mike friday.  england have a fantastic record in hong kong and have won there the last three years  but the world cup is on a different level.  every pool contains teams who have caused upsets before and we will have to work hard to ensure we progress from our group.  we have not performed consistently to our true potential so far in the irb sevens which has been disappointing - but we can only look forward.  england won the first rugby world cup sevens in 1993 with a side that included the likes of lawrence dallaglio and matt dawson. in 1997 and 2001  england lost in the quarter-finals.

527,business,bank payout to pinochet victims a us bank has said it will donate more than $8m to victims of former chilean military ruler augusto pinochet s regime under a madrid court settlement.  riggs bank will put money in a special fund to be managed by a madrid-based charity  the salvador allende foundation  which helps abused victims. the bank had been accused of illegally concealing gen pinochet s assets. more than 3 000 people were killed for political reasons under gen pinochet s regime  an official report says. last month in a us court  riggs bank pleaded guilty to failing to report suspicious activity relating to accounts held by gen pinochet and the government of equatorial guinea. on that occasion  it was ordered to pay a fine of $16m. gen pinochet himself has never been put on trial for human rights violations under his 1973-90 rule  despite several high-profile cases against him. he is now facing charges relating to the murder of one chilean and the disappearance of nine others. he is also being investigated for tax evasion  tax fraud and embezzlement of state funds.  the general s opponents rejoiced at the settlement  which was agreed in a court in the spanish capital  madrid. a lawyer for the victims  eduardo contreras  told reuters news agency:  this demonstrates that the horrors of the pinochet dictatorship are not a mystery to anyone and that the whole world knows his victims deserve reparations.  riggs spokesman mark hendrix said the settlement  details of which will be announced next week  was an opportunity to move on.  this enables the institution to put the matter behind us   he told reuters. the settlement follows a legal complaint filed against the bank by spanish judge baltasar garzon alleging that it had illegally concealed assets. the bank agreed to create a fund for the victims  but the charges were dropped.,-2.1420074
1082,politics,labour battle plan  hides blair  the tories have accused tony blair of being  terrified  of scrutiny after labour unveiled details of how it will fight the next general election.  in a break with tradition  the party will ditch the leader s battle bus and daily press briefings in westminster. instead mr blair will travel to key cities and marginal seats to deliver the party s message. labour election chief alan milburn denied the party was trying to  hide  the prime minister.  he promised  the most positive and upbeat election campaign labour has ever run . but tory co-chairman liam fox said labour s plans showed mr blair was  terrified of facing proper scrutiny .   at a time when the british people are looking for more accountability and openness  this government turns its back on them; abandoning plans to tour the country and scared to face journalists in a press conference - it does rather beg the question   what have they got to hide    the general election is widely expected next may and all the parties are stepping up their campaign preparations. mr milburn said the economy would take centre stage in labour s campaign in what would be a  watershed  election and the  last stand of the thatcherites . mr milburn said labour s slogan would be  britain is working - don t let the tories wreck it.   the tone of the campaign  said mr milburn  would be more conversational than rhetorical; more spontaneous less scripted; less national more local and less based on issues and more concentrated on people. the approach is particularly designed to appeal to women voters  he said. mr milburn brushed aside questions over why the chancellor was not present at the cabinet meeting to discuss election strategy particularly since such importance was being given to the economy.  i m not privy to everybody s diary   he said. mr brown has headed labour s preparations for previous polls but mr milburn is taking that role this time. in a break with the past  labour will not hold a daily news conference in london. it will not be a  battle bus  style campaign either  he said.  in previous elections  each party leader has had their own battle bus transporting national newspaper  television and radio reporters to staged campaign events around the country. mr milburn said labour s media effort this time would focus more on local newspapers and broadcasters  with every local radio station given the chance to interview the prime minister. mr milburn said there would also be a greater effort to set up face-to-face meetings between ministers and the electorate. former downing street media chief alastair campbell is also returning to advise labour on media strategy and campaigning.  mr milburn said no decision had been taken yet over whether david blunkett would have a prominent role in the election. liberal democrat chief executive lord rennard suggested labour was avoiding news conferences in london because it wanted less scrutiny of its record and proposals.  tony blair seems to have disappeared from labour leaflets and broadcasts   he said.  in contrast charles kennedy will feature prominently in the liberal democrat campaign right across the country.,3.0807557
1101,politics,talks aim to avert pension strike talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.  five public sector unions will hold private talks with deputy prime minister john prescott at labour s spring conference in gateshead. they want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 march. however  all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election  said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape. in four days  britain s biggest union unison will start balloting 800 000 local government workers on strikes. other public sector unions have pledged to follow. it is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.  the five unions meeting mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow  said our correspondent. but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april. privately ministers believe this will be the  less painful  option  our correspondent added. the public and commercial services union (pcs) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.  for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service  choice on this and choice on that - isn t it ironic that they re saying to public sector workers there is no choice   he said.  if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop.  in the 20th century  it s completely unacceptable.   unison s 800 000 workers  the transport and general workers  union s 70 000 and amicus  20 000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. mr prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.,2.1258857

1365,business,j&j agrees $25bn guidant deal pharmaceutical giant johnson & johnson has agreed to buy medical technology firm guidant for $25.4bn (£13bn).  guidant is a key producer of equipment that combats heart problems such as implant defibrillators and pacemakers. analysts said that the deal is aimed at offsetting johnson & johnson s reliance on a slowing drug business. they also pointed out that more mergers are likely because the drug and healthcare industries are fragmented and are under pressure to cut costs. a number of johnson & johnson s products are facing patent expirations  while the company is also battling fierce competition from generic products. meanwhile  demand for defibrillators  which give the heart a small electric shock when an irregular heartbeat or rhythm is detected  is expected to increase  analysts said. the move by johnson & johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay $76 for each guidant share  6% more than wednesday s closing price. analysts say that us antitrust regulators could force the firms to shed some overlapping stent operations. stents are tubes that are used to keep an artery open after it has been unblocked.,1.751195

508,tech,when invention turns to innovation it is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past.  when history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor  they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people s lives substantially. but  says nick donofrio  senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at ibm  it was not  the thing  itself that actually improved people s lives. it was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it. the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities  giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs  whilst having mobility and access.  when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century  we have to think more like this  but faster   mr donofrio told the bbc news website  after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture.  the invention  discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had.  the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered  but by themselves  they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did.  these are not altogether new ideas  and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years. but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea  method  or device  will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them.  we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology  argues mr donofrio  industry week s 2003 technology leader of the year. the hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work  make sense  make a difference and life gets better as a result.   in the dotcom era  there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes.  somebody had a new thing that would awe you. you weren t quite sure that it did anything  you weren t quite sure if you needed it  you weren t quite sure if it had value for it  but it was cool.  but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives  he says  will come about slowly  subtlety  and in ways that will no longer be  in your face . it will creep in pervasively. nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways  through new superconducting materials  to coatings  power  and memory storage.  i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment  in an incredible network infrastructure   says mr donofrio. pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules  and where jewellery  clothes  and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires  screens and keyboards. the net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there  like air.  people will not have to do anything to stay connected. people will know their lives are just better   says mr donofrio.  trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know.  natural interfaces will develop  devices will shape your persona  and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances.  ultimately  there will be  says mr donofrio  no value in being  computer illiterate . to some  it sounds like a technological world gone mad. to mr donofrio  it is a vision innovation that will happen. behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and  deep computing   says mr donofrio. deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data  and integral to this concept is supercomputing. it has value  according to ibm  because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions  like how to refine millions of net search results  finding cures for diseases  or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates.  but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts  commands  and requirements of a diverse world. as computing and technologies become part of the environment  part of furniture  walls  and clothing  physical space becomes a more important consideration.  this is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience.  i am confident that the set [science  engineering and technology] industry is going to be short on skills   he says.  if i am right about what innovation is  you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative.  women tend to have those traits a lot better than men.  eventually  women could win out in both life and physical sciences  he says. in the uk  a dti-funded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40% representation on set industry boards. ibm  according to mr donofrio  has 30%.  our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career.  the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and

1317,politics,labour s four little words labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which  for those just returned from the planet galifray  is  looming .  the slogan  britain forward not back  (no  it s not an instruction from one of those inter-planetary time lords) is to become as much a part of our daily lives as the sky - it s always there but we mostly stop noticing. the word  britain  is cast on a red background - a nod to old labour.  forward  is in italics and cunningly slopes forward and  along with  not back   is set against a mushy pea green background. as one of the journalists assembled at the unveiling declared  it was all very post modern  or something. great use of colour. those ad men really do earn their money. and  coincidentally  the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so-called  fagin  posters which caused tory protests have not been sacked but  as election supremo alan milburn declared   are doing a very good job .  mr milburn  in the latest in his series of pre-election-campaign campaigning  explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe labour and tony blair are the future while michael howard and the tories would take the country backwards.  not many people talk about the years before 1997 as the good old days   he declared. it would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between labour and the tories.  nobody  he claimed  could picture liberal democrat leader charles kennedy walking up downing street the day after polling. they could  however  picture michael howard or  of course  tony blair doing it. so it was only right that the campaign concentrated on rigorously examining the opposition s policies and past record. and tony blair would be in the very front line of that campaign  he said.  between now and the election the prime minister will be spending more time out of london than in it but in britain  not overseas   he promised.  he will be leading the domestic debate from the front  listening  taking the flak.  so  let s get on with it then.,-0.2630415
