Areas to look for datasets

# Translation (parallel corpora)

- Medline has translated abstracts
- WMT has a medical English-Spanish track
- The HERE database of translated pamphlets in WA (and there must be other similar ones!)
- SNOMED/ICD ontologies with synthetic data generation for complex terminology
