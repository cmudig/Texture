These files are type declarations for external libraries that don't have their own type declarations. They are not included in the `tsconfig.json` file, so they are not compiled. They are only used by the TypeScript compiler to check the types of the external libraries. 
They mostly serve to stop typescript compiler warnings.

TODO: hopefully in future these packages will be typed and can remove the .d.ts files
