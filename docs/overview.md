# Overview

Texture helps you visualize text data and structured attributes from Python. It is designed to help you understand the structure of your text data and the **relationships between text and structured attributes**.

Texture provides three main features:

1. **Interactive Attribute Profiles**: Texture visualizes structured attributes alongside your text data in interactive, cross-filterable charts.
2. **Flexible attribute definitions**: Attributes can come from different tables and any level of a document such as words, sentences, or documents.
3. **Embedding based operations**: Texture helps you use vector embeddings to search for similar text and summarize your data.
